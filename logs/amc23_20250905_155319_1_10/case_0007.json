Rearrange the equation to get $ (a-1\nStep 2: <step>\n[Core idea]: Complete the square to express the equation in a more manageable form, potentially revealing the relationship between a and b.\n[Full step]: By completing the square for the equation $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$, we have $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15 \\Rightarrow (a^2-1 + \\frac{1}{2}b^2) = \\pm \\sqrt{15}$, because $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = (a^2-1 + \\frac{1}{2}b^2)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}b^4$. The equation is now in the form of a sum of squares of real numbers being equal to 15. By listing each of the potential values of $a$ from the equation, we get $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. We can now substitute the potential values of $a$ into $b^2-2ab+1 \\geq 0$ to obtain constraints on $b$ for each of the possible values of $a$. Since we have three potential values of $a$, it is possible for the equation to be satisfied with equality for $a=-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$ and $a=\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$, and we consider the case when $a=\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$. For this case, we have $b^2-2ab+1 = \\left(b-\\frac{2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\left(2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}\\right)^2 = 0$. The solution of this equation is $b = \\sqrt{15}$.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Examine the properties of the given equation to determine the geometric or algebraic significance of the set of complex numbers satisfying it, and find the maximum value of the imaginary part of z in this context.\n[Full step]:  To find the maximum value of the imaginary part of z, we can look at the equation $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$. Since $(a^2 -1)^2 \\geq 0$ and $(a-1)^2 \\geq 0$, we have $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\leq 15$. Rearrange the equation to get $ (a-1)^2(b^2+1) \\leq 15 - (a^2-1)^2 = 2a^2 - 16a + 14$.\nStep 2: By completing the square for the equation $2a^2 - 16a + 14$, we have $2a^2 - 16a + 14 = 2\\left(a^2-8a+7\\right) = 2\\left(a^2-8a+16-9\\right) = 2\\left((a-4)^2-9\\right) = 2(a-4)^2-18$. Then, $2(a-4)^2-18 \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow (a-4)^2 \\geq 9 \\Rightarrow |a-4| \\geq 3$.\nStep 3: This means that $a-4 \\geq 3 \\Rightarrow a \\geq 7$ or $a-4 \\leq -3 \\Rightarrow a \\leq 1$.\nStep 4: Since $a \\geq 7$ or $a \\leq 1$, we know that $a-1 \\geq 6$ or $a-1 \\leq 0$.\nStep 5: Therefore, $(a-1)^2(b^2+1) \\leq 15 - (a^2-1)^2 = 2a^2 - 16a + 14 = 2(a-4)^2-18 \\leq 2(3)^2-18 = 0$. By dividing both sides by $(a-1)^2 = \\left| \\overline{z^2-1} \\right|^2$, we obtain $b^2 + 1 \\leq 0 \\Rightarrow b^2 \\leq -1\n</step>\n"

Then, $|1+z+z^2| = 4$ is equivalent to $|1 + (a+bi) + (a^2+b^2i^2)| = 4$. Since $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to $| (a^3 - a + 1) + b(1- a^2)i | = 4$. By definition of the absolute value of a complex number, this is equivalent to the equation $(a^3-a+1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 = 16$.

What is $m+n$?\n\nStep 1: <step>\n[Core idea]: Express the given condition as a polynomial equation and use the quadratic formula to find its roots.\n[Full step]: Let $z=a+bi$. Then, $|1+z+z^2| = 4$ is equivalent to $|1 + (a+bi) + (a^2+b^2i^2)| = 4$. Since $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to $| (a^3 - a + 1) + b(1- a^2)i | = 4$. By definition of the absolute value of a complex number, this is equivalent to the equation $(a^3-a+1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 = 16$. Expanding gives $(a^6-2a^4+2a^2+1) + (1-2a^2)(b^2)+b^2a^4 = 16$, or $a^6 -2a^4 + 2a^2 + 1 + b^2 -2ab^2 + a^4b^2 = 16$, which simplifies to $a^6+ a^4b^2 -2a^4 + 2a^2 + b^2-2ab^2 = 15$, or $(a^4 - 2a^2 + 1) + b^2( a^2-2a + 1) = 15$. Factoring the first part of the equation, we get $(a^2 -1)^2 + b^2(a^2-2a+1) = 15$. Then, since $(a^2-1)^2 \\geq 0$ and $(a^2-2a+1) = (a-1)^2 \\geq 0$, we have $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\geq 0$. Therefore, $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\leq 15$. Since $(a^2-1)^2 \\geq 0$ and $(a-1)^2 \\geq 0$, we have $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\leq 15$.

The equation is now in the form of a sum of squares of real numbers being equal to 15. By listing each of the potential values of $a$ from the equation, we get $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. We can now substitute the potential values of $a$ into $b^2-2ab+1 \\geq 0$ to obtain constraints on $b$ for each of the possible values of $a$. Since we have three potential values of $a$, it is possible for the equation to be satisfied with equality for $a=-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$ and $a=\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$, and we consider the case when $a=\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$. For this case, we have $b^2-2ab+1 = \\left(b-\\frac{2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\left(2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}\\right)^2 = 0$.

Since $(a^2-1)^2 \\geq 0$, it follows that $(a^2-1)^2 + (a^2-2a+1)b^2 \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow (a^2-2a+1)b^2 \\geq - (a^2-1)^2$.

We solve the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}.$ We then substitute the values of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$ to get the possible values of $b^2$. We can then take the square root of $b^2$ to get $b$, and determine which one is the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$. Since we want the value of $b^2$ to be as large as possible, we test the values of $a$.

We see that $\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}$ is the largest value, so we substitute this value of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}{(\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}.$ We can simplify this expression for $b^2$ to get $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{3}{\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Analyze the possible values of $a$ obtained from the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$, and find the corresponding values of $b$ to identify the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$.\n[Full step]:  Now that we have the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$, we can look at the possible values of $a$.

We can substitute each of these values of $a$ into the equation for $b^2$ to find the corresponding values of $b$.

This gives us $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$. We can further rearrange this equation to $(a^2-1)^2 + (a^2-2a+1)b^2 = 15$. This reveals that $(a^2-1)^2$ and $(a^2-2a+1)b^2$ are both non-negative, and their sum is 15. The maximum value of $(a^2-2a+1)$ is 1, as given by the minimum value of the quadratic $a^2-2a+1=0$. Hence, $(a^2-2a+1)b^2=0$, which implies $b=0$ or $a=1$. If $a=1$, then we have $b^2=14$. Since $b^2 \\ge 0$ for any $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we must have $b^2 \\le 14$.

We solve the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ for $b^2$.

We solve the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}.$ We then substitute the values of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$ to get the possible values of $b^2$. We can then take the square root of $b^2$ to get $b$, and determine which one is the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$. Since we want the value of $b^2$ to be as large as possible, we test the values of $a$. We have that $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$.

We see that $\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}$ is the largest value, so we substitute this value of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}{(\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}.$ We can simplify this expression for $b^2$ to get $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{3}{\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the equation $b^2-2ab+1 = 0$ to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$ and determine which value of $a$ maximizes $b$.\n[Full step]:  To solve for $b$ in terms of $a$, we use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is $b = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Substituting $a=2$ and $c=1$ into the quadratic formula gives $b = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4-4a}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{1-a}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a}$. Therefore, we have that $b=-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a}$. To maximize $b$, we need to minimize $-1 -\\sqrt{1-a}$. This occurs when $a$ is as large as possible. Thus, we must find the largest value of $a$ that satisfies the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2=15$. Using the equation $b = \\frac{-2\\pm 2\\sqrt{1-a}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a}$ in the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2=15$ gives $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a})^2 = 15$. By simplifying, we have $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2(1 - 2\\sqrt{1-a} + (1-a)) = 15$. This equation is equivalent to $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = 15 - (a^2-1)^2$. Thus, we get $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = 15 - (a^4 -2a^2 +1)$. By simplifying, we have $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = 14 - a^4 + 2a^2$. We can further simplify the equation to get $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = -a^4 + 2a^2 + 14$. Expanding the left-hand side of the equation gives $2a^3-6a^2+4a^2-4a+2a-2 = -a^\n</step>\nStep 5: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the AM-GM inequality to find a lower bound for (a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2, and then equate this to 15 to find the relationship between a and b.\n[Full step]: Since the expression (a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 is a sum of two squares, we can apply the AM-GM inequality. This inequality states that for any two non-negative real numbers x and y, the arithmetic mean of x and y is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of x and y. Applying the AM-GM inequality to (a^2-1)^2 and (a-1)^2b^2, we get (a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\geq 2\\sqrt{(a^2-1)^2(a-1)^2b^2}. Since (a-1)^2 is a common factor, we can simplify this to (a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\geq 2(a^2-1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}b. We are given that (a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15. Therefore, we have 15 \\geq 2(a^2-1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}b. Dividing both sides by 2 and then square both sides gives \\frac{15}{4} \\geq (a^2-1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}b. This is equivalent to \\sqrt{\\frac{15}{4}} \\geq (a^2-1)^{\\frac{3}{4}}b. Squaring both sides again, we have \\frac{15}{16} \\geq (a^2-1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}b^2. Since a^2-1 \\geq 0, we can multiply both sides by (a^2-1)^{\\frac{1}{2}} to get \\frac{15}{16}(a^2-1)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\geq (a^2-1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}b^2.\n\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\boxed{60}\n</step>\n</think>\n"

This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}.$ We then substitute the values of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$ to get the possible values of $b^2$. We can then take the square root of $b^2$ to get $b$, and determine which one is the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$. Since we want the value of $b^2$ to be as large as possible, we test the values of $a$. We have that $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. To maximize $b^2$, we need to find the value of $a$ that maximizes $15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2$, which will be the largest value of $a$ in the set $\\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. We see that $\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}$ is the largest value, so we substitute this value of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}{(\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}.$ We can simplify this expression for $b^2$ to get $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{3}{\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use calculus to find the maximum value of $b$ by taking the derivative of the expression for $b^2$ with respect to $a$ and setting it equal to zero.\n[Full step]:  We are given that $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}$ and we want to maximize the value of $b$. To do this, we can take the derivative of $b^2$ with respect to $a$ and set it equal to zero to find the critical points. Differentiating the expression for $b^2$ with respect to $a$ gives $\\frac{d}{da}(b^2) = \\frac{d}{da}\\left(\\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}\\right) = \\frac{(a-1)^2\\cdot(-2(a^2-1)\\cdot2a) - (15 - (a^2-1)^2)\\cdot2(a-1)}{(a-1)^4}.$ We can simplify this expression to get $\\frac{-2(a^2-1)^2(a-1)-15+ (a^2-1)^2}{(a-1)^3}.$ We can factor out the common factor $(a^2-1)$ from the numerator to get $\\frac{(a^2-1)(-2(a^2-1)(a-1)-15+ (a^2-1))}{(a-1)^3}.$ This expression can be further simplified to $\\frac{(a^2-1)(-2a^3+3a^2-2a-15)}{(a-1)^3}.$ We can now set this expression equal to zero and solve for $a$ to find the critical points. Setting the numerator equal to zero gives $-2a^3+3a^2-2a-15 = 0.$ We can factor this equation as $(a+1)(2a^2-5a+15) = 0.$ The solutions to this equation are $a=-1$ and $a=\\frac{5\\pm \\sqrt{25-60}}{4} = \\frac{5\\pm i \\sqrt{35}}{4}$.

Rearrange the equation to get $(a-1)^2b^2 = 15 - (a^2 -1)^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $|b| = \\sqrt{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}.$ In order to maximize the imaginary part of $z$, we want to maximize $b$, which is the square root of the expression on the right-hand side. Therefore, we need to minimize the value of $(a^2 -1)^2$ in order to maximize the value of $15 - (a^2 -1)^2$. We see that $(a^2-1)^2$ is minimized when $a = 1$ or $a = -1$ since $a^2$ is a squared real number. Therefore, the maximum value of $|b|$ is $\\sqrt{15 - (-1-1)^2} = \\sqrt{15-4} = \\sqrt{11}.$\n\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\boxed{11+1}\n</step>\n</think>\n"

We can then take the square root of $b^2$ to get $b$, and determine which one is the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$. Since we want the value of $b^2$ to be as large as possible, we test the values of $a$. We have that $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. To maximize $b^2$, we need to find the value of $a$ that maximizes $15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2$, which will be the largest value of $a$ in the set $\\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. We see that $\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}$ is the largest value, so we substitute this value of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}{(\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}.$ We can simplify this expression for $b^2$ to get $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{3}{\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use calculus to find the maximum value of $b$ by taking the derivative of the expression for $b^2$ with respect to $a$ and setting it equal to zero.\n[Full step]:  We are given that $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}$ and we want to maximize the value of $b$. To do this, we can take the derivative of $b^2$ with respect to $a$ and set it equal to zero to find the critical points. Differentiating the expression for $b^2$ with respect to $a$ gives $\\frac{d}{da}(b^2) = \\frac{d}{da}\\left(\\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}\\right) = \\frac{(a-1)^2\\cdot(-2(a^2-1)\\cdot2a) - (15 - (a^2-1)^2)\\cdot2(a-1)}{(a-1)^4}.$ We can simplify this expression to get $\\frac{-2(a^2-1)^2(a-1)-15+ (a^2-1)^2}{(a-1)^3}.$ We can factor out the common factor $(a^2-1)$ from the numerator to get $\\frac{(a^2-1)(-2(a^2-1)(a-1)-15+ (a^2-1))}{(a-1)^3}.$ This expression can be further simplified to $\\frac{(a^2-1)(-2a^3+3a^2-2a-15)}{(a-1)^3}.$ We can now set this expression equal to zero and solve for $a$ to find the critical points. Setting the numerator equal to zero gives $-2a^3+3a^2-2a-15 = 0.$ We can factor this equation as $(a+1)(2a^2-5a+15) = 0.$ The solutions to this equation are $a=-1$ and $a=\\frac{5\\pm \\sqrt{25-60}}{4} = \\frac{5\\pm i \\sqrt{35}}{4}$.

What is $m+n$?\n\nStep 1: <step>\n[Core idea]: Express the given condition as a polynomial equation and use the quadratic formula to find its roots.\n[Full step]: Let $z=a+bi$. Then, $|1+z+z^2| = 4$ is equivalent to $|1 + (a+bi) + (a^2+b^2i^2)| = 4$. Since $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to $| (a^3 - a + 1) + b(1- a^2)i | = 4$. By definition of the absolute value of a complex number, this is equivalent to the equation $(a^3-a+1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 = 16$. Expanding gives $(a^6-2a^4+2a^2+1) + (1-2a^2)(b^2)+b^2a^4 = 16$, or $a^6 -2a^4 + 2a^2 + 1 + b^2 -2ab^2 + a^4b^2 = 16$, which simplifies to $a^6+ a^4b^2 -2a^4 + 2a^2 + b^2-2ab^2 = 15$, or $(a^4 - 2a^2 + 1) + b^2( a^2-2a + 1) = 15$. Factoring the first part of the equation, we get $(a^2 -1)^2 + b^2(a^2-2a+1) = 15$. Then, since $(a^2-1)^2 \\geq 0$ and $(a^2-2a+1) = (a-1)^2 \\geq 0$, we have $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\geq 0$. Therefore, $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\leq 15$. Since $(a^2-1)^2 \\geq 0$ and $(a-1)^2 \\geq 0$, we have $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\leq 15$.

Note that the Triangle Inequality states that for any complex numbers z_1, z_2, we have |z_1 + z_2| \\leq |z_1| + |z_2|. By the Triangle Inequality, |1 + z + z^2| \\leq |1| + |z| + |z^2| = 1 + |z| + |z|^2. We are given that |1 + z + z^2| = 4, so we have 4 \\leq 1 + |z| + |z|^2. We can rewrite this as |z|^2 + |z| - 3 \\geq 0. Notice that |z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, so we have (\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} - 3 \\geq 0, or a^2 + b^2 + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} - 3 \\geq 0. Rearranging this equation gives \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\geq 3 - a^2 - b^2. Squaring both sides of the inequality, we have a^2 + b^2 \\geq 9 - 6a^2 - 6ab^2 + a^4 + b^4, or a^4 + b^4 - 6a^2 + 6ab^2 + a^2 + b^2 - 9 \\leq 0. Factoring the first part of the equation, we have (a^2 - 1)^2 + b^4 + b^2 - 6ab^2 + 1 + 6a^2 - 9 \\leq 0. Simplifying the equation, we get (a^2 - 1)^2 - 5b^2(1 - 2a) + 1 \\leq 0. By completing the square, we can rewrite the inequality as (a^2 - 1 - \\frac{5}{2}b^2(1-2a))^2 - \\frac{25}{4}b^2(1-2\n</step>\nSince $(a^2 - 1)^2 - 5b^2(1-2a) + 1 \\leq 0$, we have $(a^2 - 1 - \\frac{5}{2}b^2(1-2a))^2 \\leq \\frac{25}{4}b^2(1-2a)^2$. Since the left-hand side is non-negative, this is equivalent to $(a^2 - 1 - \\frac{5}{2}b^2(1-2a))^2 \\leq 0$. The only way this can be true is if $(a^2 - 1 - \\frac{5}{2}b^2(1-2a))^2 = 0$, or $a^2 - 1 - \\frac{5}{2}b^2(1-2a) = 0$.\n</step>\n\n<step>\nSolving for $b^2$ in the equation $a^2 - 1 - \\frac{5}{2}b^2(1-2a) = 0$, we have $a^2 - 1 = \\frac{5}{2}b^2(1-2a)$. This simplifies to $2a^2 - 2 = 5b^2(1-2a)$, or $2a^2-2=5b^2-10ab^2$. Rearranging, we get $10ab^2-5b^2+2a^2-2=0$. Then factor out $b^2$ to get $b^2(10a-5)+2a^2-2=0$. We can rewrite the equation as $b^2(10a-5)=-2a^2+2$. Factor out 2 from the right-hand side to get $b^2(10a-5)=-a^2+1$. Now we can divide both sides of the equation by $5$ to get $b^2(2a-1)=\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{a^2}{5}$. Rearrange the equation to get $b^2=\\frac{\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{a^2}{5}}{2a-1}$.\n</step>\n\n<step>\nSince $b^2=\\frac{\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{a^2}{5}}{2a-1}$, we have $b^2=\\frac{\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{a^2}{5}}{2a-1}$. If $2a-1=0$, then $a=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $b^2=\\frac{\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{1}{4}}{0}$, which is undefined. Therefore, we have $2a-1 \\neq 0$, so $2a-1 \\neq 0$. This implies that $2a-1\\neq0$, or $2a - 1 \\neq 0$. Therefore, $\\frac{\\frac{1}{5}-\\frac{a^2}{5}}{2a-1} \\neq \\frac{0}{0}$. By canceling the common factor of 5 in the numerator and denominator, we have $\\frac{1-a^2}{2a-1}\\neq\\frac{0}{0}$. Let $x=2a-1$, then $\\frac{1-a^2}{2a-1}=\\frac{1-\\frac{x+1}{2}}{x}=\\frac{2-(x+1)}{x}=\\frac{1-x}{x}$. Therefore, we have $\\frac{1-x}{x}\\neq\\frac{0}{0}$. Since $\\frac{1-x}{x}$ is undefined when $x=0$, we must have $x\\neq 0$ or $2a-1\\neq 0$. However, we have already established that $2a-1\\neq 0$, so we have $x\\neq0$. The function $f(x)=\\frac{1-x}{x}$ is defined for all real numbers $x\\neq 0$ and is continuous on $(0, \\infty)$ and $(-\\infty, 0)$.

The equation is now in the form of a sum of squares of real numbers being equal to 15. By listing each of the potential values of $a$ from the equation, we get $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. We can now substitute the potential values of $a$ into $b^2-2ab+1 \\geq 0$ to obtain constraints on $b$ for each of the possible values of $a$. Since we have three potential values of $a$, it is possible for the equation to be satisfied with equality for $a=-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$ and $a=\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$, and we consider the case when $a=\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$. For this case, we have $b^2-2ab+1 = \\left(b-\\frac{2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\left(2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}\\right)^2 = 0$. The solution of this equation is $b = \\sqrt{15}$.\n</step>\n[Core idea]: Determine the relationship between $a$ and $b$ for the equation $b^2-2ab+1 = 0$ and apply this relationship to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$.\n\nFirst, by solving the equation $b^2-2ab+1 = 0$ for $b$, we get $b = \\frac{2a \\pm \\sqrt{4a^2-4}}{2} = a \\pm \\sqrt{a^2-1}$. This equation indicates that for any given $a$, we have two possible values for $b$. Let's choose the positive value of $b$ since we are interested in the maximum value of $b$. Thus, we have $b = a + \\sqrt{a^2-1}$.\nNow, since $b = a + \\sqrt{a^2-1}$, we can substitute this into the original equation to get a relationship between $a$ and the imaginary part of $z$. The imaginary part of $z$ is given by the second term $b$ in the complex number $z=a+bi$. So, the imaginary part of $z$ is equal to $a + \\sqrt{a^2-1}$.\n\nTo find the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$, we need to find the maximum value of $a + \\sqrt{a^2-1}$. By inspection, this expression is maximized when $a^2-1$ is maximized. Since $a^2-1 \\ge 0$ for all real numbers $a$, the maximum value of $a^2-1$ is $\\infty$, which is unbounded. However, when $a^2-1$ is maximized, the value of the expression $a + \\sqrt{a^2-1}$ is also maximized. Furthermore, since $a + \\sqrt{a^2-1}$ is maximized when $a^2-1$ is maximized, it would be difficult to find the exact value of the expression. However, we are given that the expression $a + \\sqrt{a^2-1}$ can be written in the form $\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.\n\nTo find the maximum value of $a + \\sqrt{a^2-1}$, we can square both sides of the inequality $a^2-1 \\le a^2$ to get $a^2-1 \\le a^2 \\Rightarrow 0 \\le 2a^2-1$. Then, we can take the square root of both sides of the inequality to get $0 \\le \\sqrt{2a^2-1}$. Since we want to find the maximum value of $a + \\sqrt{a^2-1}$, we can square both sides of the inequality $\\sqrt{2a^2-1} \\le a$ to get $2a^2-1 \\le a^2 \\Rightarrow a^2-1 \\le 0 \\Rightarrow a^2 \\le 1$. Then, we can take the square root of both sides of the inequality to get $a \\le 1$. \n\nNow, we can substitute $a = 1$ into the inequality $a \\le 1$ to get the maximum value of the expression. Substituting $a = 1$ into the inequality $a \\le 1$ gives us $1 \\le 1$, which is true. Therefore, we have $a = 1$ for the maximum value.\n\nSubstituting $a = 1$ into the expression $a + \\sqrt{a^2-1}$, we get $1 + \\sqrt{1^2-1} = 1 + \\sqrt{0} = 1 + 0 = 1$. Therefore, the maximum value of the expression $a + \\sqrt{a^2-1}$ is $1$.\n\nHowever, we need to write the answer in the form $\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$.

We solve the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}.$ We then substitute the values of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$ to get the possible values of $b^2$. We can then take the square root of $b^2$ to get $b$, and determine which one is the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$.

We can use the original equation $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ to find the value of $b$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}$.

Then, the equation becomes $x^3 + (b^2 - 2x + 1)x^2 + (2x - 2b^2)x + b^2 - 15 = 0$. This is a cubic equation in $x$ and $b$, which can be solved using the cubic formula. However, since the equation is a polynomial equation in two variables, we can also approach it by fixing the value of one variable and solving for the other. For example, we can fix the value of $b$ and solve for $a$. However, since the equation is quadratic in $a$, we can solve for $a$ using the quadratic formula. To do this, we can express $a$ as $x = a^2$ and rewrite the equation as $(b^2 - 2x + 1)(x^2) + (2x - 2b^2)x + b^2 - 15 = 0$. Since $x = a^2$, we have $a = \\pm\\sqrt{x}$. Substituting this into the equation and simplifying, we get $(b^2 - 2x + 1)(x^2) + (2\\pm 2\\sqrt{x} - 2b^2)x + b^2 - 15 = 0$. Rearranging and combining like terms, we get $x^2(b^2 - 2) + (2\\pm 2\\sqrt{x} - 2b^2)x + b^2 - 15 = 0$. This is a quadratic equation in $x$, which can be solved using the quadratic formula. Now we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of this equation. The quadratic formula states that the roots of the equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ are given by $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.

In our case, $a = b^2 - 2$, $b = 2\\pm 2\\sqrt{x}$, and $c = b^2 - 15$. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get $x = \\frac{(2\\pm 2\\sqrt{x})(2\\mp 2\\sqrt{x}) - 4(b^2 - 15)}{2(b^2 - 2)}$. Simplifying, we get $x = \\frac{4 - 4x - 4b^2 + 60}{2b^2 - 4}$, which further simplifies to $x = \\frac{56 - 4b^2}{2b^2 - 4}$. This is the equation of a quadratic curve in $b$, which can be rewritten as $x = \\frac{28 - 2b^2}{b^2 - 2}$.\n\nTo find the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$, we need to analyze the roots of this equation.

The quotient rule states that if $f(x) = \\frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$, then $f'(x) = \\frac{h(x)g'(x) - g(x)h'(x)}{(h(x))^2}$. In our case, we have $x = \\frac{28 - 2b^2}{b^2 - 2}$. Let's identify $g(x) = 28 - 2b^2$ and $h(x) = b^2 - 2$. Then, $g'(x) = -4b$ and $h'(x) = 2b$. Substituting these values into the quotient rule formula, we get $x' = \\frac{(b^2 - 2)(-4b) - (28 - 2b^2)(2b)}{(b^2 - 2)^2}$. Simplifying, we get $x' = \\frac{-4b^3 + 8b + 56b - 4b^3}{(b^2 - 2)^2}$. Combining like terms, we get $x' = \\frac{112b}{(b^2 - 2)^2}$. This is the derivative of $x$ with respect to $b$.\n\nNow, we need to set $x'$ equal to zero and solve for $b$.

Therefore, we have $x^2 - 2x + 1 \\geq 0$ if and only if $x \\leq 1$ or $x \\geq 1$. Substituting back $x = a^2$, we get $a^2 \\leq 1$ or $a^2 \\geq 1$. This is the same as the previous result $a^2 \\geq 1$ or $a \\leq -1$. We can combine these two inequalities to get $a^2 \\geq 1$, which is equivalent to $(a^2 - 1)^2 \\geq 0$. Rearranging this inequality, we get $(a-1)^2b^2 \\leq 15 - (a^2 -1)^2 = 15 - a^4 + 2a^2 - 1 = -a^4 + 2a^2 + 14$. We can rewrite this inequality as $b^2 \\leq -\\frac{a^4 - 2a^2 + 14}{(a-1)^2}$. The maximum value of $b^2$ occurs when the denominator is minimum. Since the denominator is $(a-1)^2$, which is always non-negative, we have the maximum value of $b^2$ when $(a-1)^2 = 0$, or $a = 1$. Substituting this value of $a$ into the inequality, we get $b^2 \\leq -\\frac{1 - 2 + 14}{0}$, which is undefined. Therefore, we must have $a \\neq 1$. Let $a = 1 + \\epsilon$ for some small positive value of $\\epsilon$. Substituting this into the inequality, we get $b^2 \\leq -\\frac{(1+\\epsilon)^4 - 2(1+\\epsilon)^2 + 14}{\\epsilon^2} = -\\frac{1+4\\epsilon+6\\epsilon^2+4\\epsilon^3+\\epsilon^4 - 2 - 4\\epsilon - 2\\epsilon^2 + 14}{\\epsilon^2} = -\\frac{9+2\\epsilon^2+4\\epsilon^3 + \\epsilon^4}{\\epsilon^2} = -\\frac{9}{\\epsilon^2} -2 - 4\\epsilon - \\frac{4\\epsilon^3}{\\epsilon^2} - \\frac{\\epsilon^4}{\\epsilon^2} = -\\frac{9}{\\epsilon^2} - 2 - 4\\epsilon - 4\\epsilon - \\epsilon^2 = -\\frac{9}{\\epsilon^2} - 8\\epsilon - \\epsilon^2$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, we have $\\frac{-9}{\\epsilon^2} \\to -\\infty$ and $-\\epsilon^2 \\to 0$. Therefore, we must have $-8\\epsilon \\to 0$. Since $\\epsilon$ is an arbitrary small positive value, this implies",

This can be rewritten as $z^2(z+1) + (z-4) = 0$, which factors as $(z^2+1)(z+4) = 0$. Setting each factor to zero, we get $z^2+1 = 0$ and $z+4 = 0$. Since $z^2+1 = 0$ has no real solutions, the only real solution is $z = -4$. However, we need to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$.

Now, we can expand $(a^2-1)^2$ and $b^2(a^2-2a+1)$ to get $a^4-2a^2+1+b^2a^2-2ab^2+ b^2 = 15$. This simplifies to $a^4+b^2a^2-2a^2-2ab^2+b^2-14 = 0$.

By the Triangle Inequality, |1 + z + z^2| \\leq |1| + |z| + |z^2| = 1 + |z| + |z|^2. We are given that |1 + z + z^2| = 4, so we have 4 \\leq 1 + |z| + |z|^2. We can rewrite this as |z|^2 + |z| - 3 \\geq 0. Notice that |z| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, so we have (\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} - 3 \\geq 0, or a^2 + b^2 + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} - 3 \\geq 0. Rearranging this equation gives \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\geq 3 - a^2 - b^2. Squaring both sides of the inequality, we have a^2 + b^2 \\geq 9 - 6a^2 - 6ab^2 + a^4 + b^4, or a^4 + b^4 - 6a^2 + 6ab^2 + a^2 + b^2 - 9 \\leq 0. Factoring the first part of the equation, we have (a^2 - 1)^2 + b^4 + b^2 - 6ab^2 + 1 + 6a^2 - 9 \\leq 0. Simplifying the equation, we get (a^2 - 1)^2 - 5b^2(1 - 2a) + 1 \\leq 0. By completing the square, we can rewrite the inequality as (a^2 - 1 - \\frac{5}{2}b^2(1-2a))^2 - \\frac{25}{4}b^2(1-2\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the fact that $|1+z+z^2| = 4$ to derive the modulus of the complex number $1+z+z^2$ and then use its properties to relate $a$ and $b$.\n[Full step]: Since $|1+z+z^2| = 4$, the complex number $1+z+z^2$ lies on a circle of radius 4 in the complex plane. We can write $1+z+z^2 = 4e^{i\\theta}$, where $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$. Then, $z$ can be written as $z = 4(\\cos\\theta-1) + i4\\sin\\theta$. Since $z = a+bi$, we have $a = 4(\\cos\\theta-1)$ and $b = 4\\sin\\theta$. Since $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, we have $a = 4(\\cos\\theta-1) = 4\\cos\\theta - 4$ and $b = 4\\sin\\theta$. We can use these expressions for $a$ and $b$ to relate them. We have $a^2 + b^2 = (4\\cos\\theta - 4)^2 + (4\\sin\\theta)^2 = 16\\cos^2\\theta - 32\\cos\\theta + 16 + 16\\sin^2\\theta = 16 - 32\\cos\\theta + 16 = 32 - 32\\cos\\theta$.\n</step>\n[Core idea]: Use the previous inequality to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$.\n[Full step]: Since $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\leq 15$, we have $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ if and only if $a^2-1 \\geq 0$ and $a-1 \\geq 0$. Since $a^2-1 \\geq 0$, we have $a \\geq 1$ and since $a-1 \\geq 0$, we have $a \\geq 1$. Thus, $a \\geq 1$. Then, we have $a^2-1 \\leq 15 - (a-1)^2b^2$, so we have $(a^2-1)^2 \\leq 15(a-1)^2b^2$. Also, note that $a^2-1 \\leq 15(a-1)^2b^2$ implies that $a^2-1 \\leq 15b^2(a-1)^2$, or $\\frac{a^2-1}{(a-1)^2} \\leq 15b^2$. Since $a \\geq 1$, we have $\\frac{a^2-1}{(a-1)^2} = a \\leq 15b^2$. Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we have $\\frac{1}{a} \\geq \\frac{1}{15b^2}$. We can rearrange this to get $\\frac{1}{15b^2} \\leq \\frac{1}{a}$. Since $\\frac{1}{a} \\geq \\frac{1}{15b^2}$, we have $a \\geq 15b^2$. We can use this inequality to find the maximum value of $b$. Since $a \\geq 1$, we have $a^2 \\geq 1$. Then, we have $a^2 \\geq 1 + 2ab + b^2$, which means that $a^2 - 2ab - b^2 \\geq 1$. If $a^2-2ab-b^2=0$, the inequality is an equality, and we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of $a$ and $b$ that make it true. The quadratic formula states that if $ax^2+bx+c=0$, then $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Since $a^2 -2ab-b^2=0$, we can write it as $a^2 -2ab-b^2=0$, or $a^2 - 2ab - b^2 = (a-b)^2 - b^2 = 0$. The quadratic formula states that $a-b = \\frac{-(-2b) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2b)^2-4(1)(-b^2)}}{2(1)}$, which simplifies to $a-b = 2b \\pm \\sqrt{4b^2+4b^2}$. Since $(a-b)^2 \\geq 0$ for all $a,b$, we have $a-b = 2b \\pm 2\\sqrt{b^2+b^2} = 2b \\pm 2\\sqrt{2b^2} = 2b \\pm 2b\\sqrt{2}$. We can write this as $a-b=(2b)(1 \\pm \\sqrt{2})$. Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we have $\\frac{1}{a-b} = \\frac{1}{2b(1 \\pm \\sqrt{2})}$. We can simplify this to $\\frac{1}{a-b} = \\frac{1}{2b} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}}$. Since $\\frac{1}{a-b} \\geq \\frac{1}{2b}$, we have $\\frac{1}{2b} \\leq \\frac{1}{2b} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}}$. We can divide both sides by $\\frac{1}{2b}$ to get $1 \\leq \\frac{1}{1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}}$. We can multiply both sides by $(1 \\pm \\sqrt{2})$ to get $(1 \\pm \\sqrt{2}) \\leq 1$. We can add $1",

We can rewrite this as $|1+(a+bi)+(a^2+b^2i^2)|=4$. Since $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to $|1 + (a+bi) + (a^2-b^2)| = 4$. By definition of the absolute value of a complex number, this is equivalent to the equation $(1 + a + a^2 - b^2)^2 + b^2 = 16$.

Since we want to find the maximum value of $b$, which is the imaginary part of $z$, we can use the fact that $b^2 \\leq 15$ to get $a^4 - 2a^3 + 2a^2 + b^2 + b^4 + 2a - 15 \\leq a^4 - 2a^3 + 2a^2 + 15 + 2a - 15 = a^4 - 2a^3 + 2a^2 + 2a = (a^2 - 1)^2 + 2a$.

Therefore, $a^4 - 2a^3 + 2a^2 + b^2 + b^4 + 2a - 15 \\leq a^4 = (a^2 - 1)^2 + 2a + 1$.

Then, $|1+z+z^2| = 4$ is equivalent to $|1 + (a+bi) + (a^2+b^2i^2)| = 4$. Since $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to $| (a^3 - a + 1) + b(1- a^2)i | = 4$. By definition of the absolute value of a complex number, this is equivalent to the equation $(a^3-a+1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 = 16$.

Factoring the first part of the equation, we get $(a^2 -1)^2 + b^2(a^2-2a+1) = 15$. Then, since $(a^2-1)^2 \\geq 0$ and $(a^2-2a+1) = (a-1)^2 \\geq 0$, we have $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\geq 0$.

The equation is now in the form of a sum of squares of real numbers being equal to 15. By listing each of the potential values of $a$ from the equation, we get $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. We can now substitute the potential values of $a$ into $b^2-2ab+1 \\geq 0$ to obtain constraints on $b$ for each of the possible values of $a$. Since we have three potential values of $a$, it is possible for the equation to be satisfied with equality for $a=-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$ and $a=\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$, and we consider the case when $a=\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$.

To this end, we plug in different values of $a$ and $b$ into the equation and determine the values of $a$ and $b$ that produce the maximum value of the imaginary part.

The method of Lagrange multipliers is a powerful tool for finding the maximum or minimum of a function subject to a constraint. In this case, we want to maximize the imaginary part of $z$, which is given by $b$, subject to the constraint that $|1+z+z^2|=4$. We can write the Lagrangian function as $L(a,b,\\lambda) = b + \\lambda((a^3 - a + 1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 - 16)$. The partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to $a$, $b$, and $\\lambda$ are $L_a = 0$, $L_b = 1 + 2\\lambda b (1-a^2)$, and $L_\\lambda = (a^3 - a + 1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 - 16$. Setting these partial derivatives equal to zero and solving for $a$, $b$, and $\\lambda$, we get $a = \\pm 1$, $b = \\pm \\sqrt{15}$, and $\\lambda = \\pm \\frac{1}{2a^2-1}$. Now, we can substitute these values back into the equation $|1+z+z^2|=4$ to get $(a^3 - a + 1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 = 16$. Since we want to maximize the imaginary part of $z$, we choose the value of $b$ that is positive. Therefore, the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ is $b = \\sqrt{15}$.\n\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\boxed{16}\n</step>\n</think>\n",

We solve the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}.$ We then substitute the values of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$ to get the possible values of $b^2$. We can then take the square root of $b^2$ to get $b$, and determine which one is the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$.

Therefore, we can only consider the values of $a$ from this set, so we can disregard the complex solutions. Now, let's consider the critical points $a=-1$ and $a=\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}$. We can substitute these values of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$ to get the possible values of $b^2$. We have that $\\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2} = \\frac{15 - (1)^2}{(0)^2} = 14$ for $a=-1$ and $\\frac{15 - (\\left(\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 -1)^2}{\\left(\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}-1\\right)^2} = \\frac{15 - (\\frac{7}{4})^2}{\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{175}{16}}{\\frac{9}{4}} = \\frac{175}{36}$ for $a=\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}$. The value of $b$ is the square root of $b^2$, so we can take the square root of $b^2$ to get $b$, and determine which one is the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$. We have that $b = \\pm \\sqrt{14}$ for $a=-1$ and $b = \\pm \\frac{5\\sqrt{7}}{6}$ for $a=\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}$.

What is $m+n$?\n\nStep 1: <step>\n[Core idea]: Express the given condition as a polynomial equation and use the quadratic formula to find its roots.\n[Full step]: Let $z=a+bi$. Then, $|1+z+z^2| = 4$ is equivalent to $|1 + (a+bi) + (a^2+b^2i^2)| = 4$. Since $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to $| (a^3 - a + 1) + b(1- a^2)i | = 4$. By definition of the absolute value of a complex number, this is equivalent to the equation $(a^3-a+1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 = 16$. Expanding gives $(a^6-2a^4+2a^2+1) + (1-2a^2)(b^2)+b^2a^4 = 16$, or $a^6 -2a^4 + 2a^2 + 1 + b^2 -2ab^2 + a^4b^2 = 16$, which simplifies to $a^6+ a^4b^2 -2a^4 + 2a^2 + b^2-2ab^2 = 15$, or $(a^4 - 2a^2 + 1) + b^2( a^2-2a + 1) = 15$. Factoring the first part of the equation, we get $(a^2 -1)^2 + b^2(a^2-2a+1) = 15$. Then, since $(a^2-1)^2 \\geq 0$ and $(a^2-2a+1) = (a-1)^2 \\geq 0$, we have $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\geq 0$.

The equation is now in the form of a sum of squares of real numbers being equal to 15. By listing each of the potential values of $a$ from the equation, we get $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. We can now substitute the potential values of $a$ into $b^2-2ab+1 \\geq 0$ to obtain constraints on $b$ for each of the possible values of $a$. Since we have three potential values of $a$, it is possible for the equation to be satisfied with equality for $a=-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$ and $a=\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$, and we consider the case when $a=\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$. For this case, we have $b^2-2ab+1 = \\left(b-\\frac{2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\left(2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}\\right)^2 = 0$. The solution of this equation is $b = \\sqrt{15}$.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Analyze the given equation to find the relationship between a and b that maximizes the imaginary part of z, such as by using calculus or algebraic manipulations.\n[Full step]:  Since the expression for $b$ obtained from the equation $b = \\sqrt{15}$ is not the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$, we must look for the relationship between $a$ and $b$ that maximizes the imaginary part. We solve the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}.$ We then substitute the values of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$ to get the possible values of $b^2$. We can then take the square root of $b^2$ to get $b$, and determine which one is the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$. Since we want the value of $b^2$ to be as large as possible, we test the values of $a$. We have that $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. To maximize $b^2$, we need to find the value of $a$ that maximizes $15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2$, which will be the largest value of $a$ in the set $\\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. We see that $\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}$ is the largest value, so we substitute this value of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}{(\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}.$ We can simplify this expression for $b^2$ to get $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{3}{\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the equation $b^2-2ab+1 = 0$ to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$ and determine which value of $a$ maximizes $b$.\n[Full step]:  To solve for $b$ in terms of $a$, we use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is $b = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Substituting $a=2$ and $c=1$ into the quadratic formula gives $b = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4-4a}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{1-a}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a}$. Therefore, we have that $b=-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a}$. To maximize $b$, we need to minimize $-1 -\\sqrt{1-a}$. This occurs when $a$ is as large as possible. Thus, we must find the largest value of $a$ that satisfies the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2=15$. Using the equation $b = \\frac{-2\\pm 2\\sqrt{1-a}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a}$ in the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2=15$ gives $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a})^2 = 15$. By simplifying, we have $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2(1 - 2\\sqrt{1-a} + (1-a)) = 15$. This equation is equivalent to $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = 15 - (a^2-1)^2$. Thus, we get $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = 15 - (a^4 -2a^2 +1)$. By simplifying, we have $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = 14 - a^4 + 2a^2$. We can further simplify the equation to get $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = -a^4 + 2a^2 + 14$. Expanding the left-hand side of the equation gives $2a^3-6a^2+4a^2-4a+2a-2 = -a^\n</step>\n[Core idea]: The steps were cut off. We will continue from the previous step.\n[Full step]:  From the equation $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = -a^4 + 2a^2 + 14$, we can simplify and rewrite it as $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = -a^4 + 2a^2 + 14$. Factoring out a $-2$ from the right-hand side of the equation, we get $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = -2(a^4/2 - a^2 - 7)$. We can further simplify the equation to get $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = -2(a^4/2 - a^2 - 7)$. We can then factor out a $-2$ from the right-hand side of the equation to obtain $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = -2(a^2(a^2/2 - 1) - 7)$. We can then factor $a^2$ out of the first term on the right-hand side to obtain $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = -2a^2(a^2/2 - 1) +14$. Let's simplify the equation further to get $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = -\\frac{1}{2}a^2(a^2 - 2) + 14$. Expanding and simplifying, we have $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = -\\frac{1}{2}a^4 + a^2 + 14$. We can factor out a $2$ from the left-hand side of the equation to obtain $2(a-1)^2(a-1) = -\\frac{1}{2}a^4 + a^2 + 14$. Now, let's simplify the left-hand side of the equation to get $2(a^2 -2a +1)(a-1) = -\\frac{1}{2}a^4 + a^2 + 14$. By simplifying the left-hand side, we have $2(a^3 - 3a^2 + 2a - 1) = -\\frac{1}{2}a^4 + a^2 + 14$. Expanding the left-hand side of the equation gives $2a^3 - 6a^2 + 4a - 2 = -\\frac{1}{2}a^4 + a^2 + 14$. We can further simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by $-2$ to obtain $-4a^3 + 12a^2 - 8a + 4 = a^4 - 2a^2 - 28$. We can then move all terms to the right-hand side of the equation to get $a^4 - 4a^3 + 14a^2 - 8a + 32 = 0$. We can then factor this equation using rational root theorem, which gives $(a-2)(a^3 - 2a^2 + 12a -16) = 0$. We can factor the cubic polynomial $a^3 - 2a^2 + 12a - 16$ further to obtain $(a-2)(a^2 + 10) = 0$. Now, the equation is factored as $$(a-2)(a-2)(a^2 + 10) = 0.$$ Since the first two factors are the same, we can rewrite the equation as $(a-2)^2(a^2 + 10) = 0$. The solutions to this equation are $a = \\boxed{2}",

In order to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$, we need to consider the points on the circle that are farthest from the origin.

Therefore, the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ is the imaginary part of the point on the circle at a distance of 4 from the origin. The equation of the circle can be written as $(x-1/2)^2 + y^2 = 4^2$, which represents a circle centered at $(1/2, 0)$ with radius 4. The point on this circle with the maximum imaginary part is at the topmost point of the circle, which is at a distance of 4 from the center $(1/2, 0)$.

What is $m+n$?\n\nStep 1: <step>\n[Core idea]: Express the given condition as a polynomial equation and use the quadratic formula to find its roots.\n[Full step]: Let $z=a+bi$. Then, $|1+z+z^2| = 4$ is equivalent to $|1 + (a+bi) + (a^2+b^2i^2)| = 4$. Since $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to $| (a^3 - a + 1) + b(1- a^2)i | = 4$. By definition of the absolute value of a complex number, this is equivalent to the equation $(a^3-a+1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 = 16$. Expanding gives $(a^6-2a^4+2a^2+1) + (1-2a^2)(b^2)+b^2a^4 = 16$, or $a^6 -2a^4 + 2a^2 + 1 + b^2 -2ab^2 + a^4b^2 = 16$, which simplifies to $a^6+ a^4b^2 -2a^4 + 2a^2 + b^2-2ab^2 = 15$, or $(a^4 - 2a^2 + 1) + b^2( a^2-2a + 1) = 15$. Factoring the first part of the equation, we get $(a^2 -1)^2 + b^2(a^2-2a+1) = 15$. Then, since $(a^2-1)^2 \\geq 0$ and $(a^2-2a+1) = (a-1)^2 \\geq 0$, we have $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\geq 0$.

The equation is now in the form of a sum of squares of real numbers being equal to 15. By listing each of the potential values of $a$ from the equation, we get $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. We can now substitute the potential values of $a$ into $b^2-2ab+1 \\geq 0$ to obtain constraints on $b$ for each of the possible values of $a$.

We solve the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}.$ We then substitute the values of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$ to get the possible values of $b^2$. We can then take the square root of $b^2$ to get $b$, and determine which one is the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$. Since we want the value of $b^2$ to be as large as possible, we test the values of $a$. We have that $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$.

We see that $\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}$ is the largest value, so we substitute this value of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}{(\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}.$ We can simplify this expression for $b^2$ to get $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{3}{\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Analyze the possible values of $a$ obtained from the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$, and find the corresponding values of $b$ to identify the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$.\n[Full step]:  Now that we have the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$, we can look at the possible values of $a$. We have $a \\in \\left\\{-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}, \\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}, -\\sqrt{15}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. We can substitute each of these values of $a$ into the equation for $b^2$ to find the corresponding values of $b$. For the first value $a = -\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}$, we have $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}-1)^2}{(-\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}-1)^2}$. Simplifying this expression for $b^2$, we get $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2+1+2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2})}{(15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2+1+2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2})} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{4}b^2 -2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}}{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2+1+2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}}$. We can factor out $-\\frac{1}{4}$ from the first term in the numerator to get $b^2 = -\\frac{1}{4}\\left(b^2 + 2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2}\\right)$. Since $b^2 \\geq 0$ for any $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we must have $b^2 + 2\\sqrt{15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2} \\leq 0$. However, since $15+\\frac{1}{4}b^2 \\geq 15 > 0\n</step>\nStep 5: <step>\n[Core idea]: Analyze the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ using calculus to find the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$.\n[Full step]: The equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ can be viewed as an equation of a curve in the $ab$-plane. The maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ occurs when the graph of the curve is tangent to the line $b=0$, which is the real axis. This means that we need to find the derivative of the equation with respect to $a$ and set it to zero to find the critical points. Differentiating the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ with respect to $a$, we get $2(a^2-1)(2a) + 2(a-1)b^2 = 0$. Simplifying this expression, we get $4a(a^2-1) + 2(a-1)b^2 = 0$. Rearranging this equation, we have $4a^3 - 4a + 2ab^2 - 2b^2 = 0$. Since we are interested in the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$, we want to find the value of $a$ that maximizes $b^2$. From the expression for $b^2$, we have $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2-1)^2}{(a-1)^2}$. We can see that $b^2$ is maximized when the numerator is maximized and the denominator is minimized. The numerator is maximized when $a^2-1$ is minimized, which occurs when $a^2=1$, giving the maximum value of the numerator as $15-1^2=14$. The denominator is minimized when $a-1$ is minimized, which also occurs when $a=1$. Therefore, the maximum value of $b^2$ occurs when $a=1$. Substituting $a=1$ into the expression for $b^2$, we get $b^2 = \\frac{15-1}{0}$, which is undefined. This is not possible, so we must look for another value of $a$ that maximizes $b^2$.\n\n<step>\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\boxed{111}\n</think>\n",

We see that $\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}$ is the largest value, so we substitute this value of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}{(\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}.$ We can simplify this expression for $b^2$ to get $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{3}{\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the equation $b^2-2ab+1 = 0$ to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$ and determine which value of $a$ maximizes $b$.\n[Full step]:  To solve for $b$ in terms of $a$, we use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is $b = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Substituting $a=2$ and $c=1$ into the quadratic formula gives $b = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4-4a}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{1-a}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a}$.

Thus, we must find the largest value of $a$ that satisfies the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2=15$. Using the equation $b = \\frac{-2\\pm 2\\sqrt{1-a}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a}$ in the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2=15$ gives $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-a})^2 = 15$. By simplifying, we have $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2(1 - 2\\sqrt{1-a} + (1-a)) = 15$. This equation is equivalent to $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = 15 - (a^2-1)^2$. Thus, we get $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = 15 - (a^4 -2a^2 +1)$. By simplifying, we have $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = 14 - a^4 + 2a^2$. We can further simplify the equation to get $(a-1)^2(2a-2) = -a^4 + 2a^2 + 14$.

This inequality states that for any two non-negative real numbers x and y, the arithmetic mean of x and y is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of x and y. Applying the AM-GM inequality to (a^2-1)^2 and (a-1)^2b^2, we get (a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\geq 2\\sqrt{(a^2-1)^2(a-1)^2b^2}. Since (a-1)^2 is a common factor, we can simplify this to (a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\geq 2(a^2-1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}b. We are given that (a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15.

We know that (a^2 - 1)^2 is always nonnegative. Since a(b - 1)^2 is also nonnegative, (a^2 - 1)^2 + a(b - 1)^2 - 1 ≥ -1. Therefore, the maximum value of (a^2 - 1)^2 + a(b - 1)^2 - 1 is -1. We have (a^2 - 1)^2 + a(b - 1)^2 - 1 = -1, which implies that (a^2 - 1)^2 = 0. Thus, a^2 = 1. Since a is real, we have a = ±1. If a = -1, then b^2 - 2b - 1 = -1 - 1, which gives b^2 - 2b = -2. By solving this quadratic equation, we find b = 1 ± \\sqrt{3}. If a = 1, then b^2 - 2b + 1 = 1 - 2 + 1, which gives b^2 - 2b = -1. By solving this quadratic equation, we find b = 1. Therefore, the possible values of b are 1, 1 + \\sqrt{3}, and 1 - \\sqrt{3}. We can now substitute these values of b into the equation b^2 - 2ab + 1 = 0 to find the corresponding values of a. Substituting b = 1 into the equation gives a^2 - 2a + 1 = 0, which gives a = 1.\n</step>\n[Core idea]: Apply the quadratic formula to find the relationship between a and b that maximizes the imaginary part of z.\n[Full step]:  Since we want to maximize the imaginary part of $z$, we need to maximize $b$. To find the relationship between $a$ and $b$ that maximizes $b$, we can use the quadratic formula to solve the equation $b^2 - 2ab + 1 = 0$. The quadratic formula is $b = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Since this is an equation with one variable ($b$) in terms of another variable ($a$), we can't directly apply the quadratic formula. Therefore, we need to rewrite the equation $b^2 - 2ab + 1 = 0$ in the form $b^2 - 2ab + a^2 = a^2 + 1$, which is a quadratic equation in $b$. Now we can apply the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is $b = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$. Substituting $a=1$ and $c=a^2+1$ into the quadratic formula gives $b = \\frac{-2a \\pm \\sqrt{4a^2-4(a^2+1)}}{2} = \\frac{-2a \\pm \\sqrt{-4}}{2} = -a \\pm i$. Therefore, we have that $b = -a \\pm i$. To maximize $b$, we need to minimize $a$. Thus, we must find the smallest value of $a$ that satisfies the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2=15$. Using the equation $b = -a \\pm i$ in the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2=15$ gives $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2(-a \\pm i)^2=15$. By simplifying, we have $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2(a^2 - 2a + 1) = 15$. This equation is equivalent to $(a^2-1)^2 + a(a-1)^4 = 15$. Thus, we get $a^4 - 2a^2 + 1 + a(a^4 - 4a^3 + 6a^2 - 4a + 1) = 15$. By simplifying, we have $a^5 - 4a^4 + 6a^3 - 4a^2 + a + a^4 - 2a^2 + 1 = 15$. We can further simplify the equation to get $a^5 - 4a^4 + 6a^3 - 6a^2 + a + 1 = 15$. This equation is equivalent to $a^5 - 4a^4 + 6a^3 - 6a^2 + a - 14 = 0$. Since we want to find the smallest value of $a$ that satisfies the equation, we can try to find the roots of this equation. The rational root theorem states that any rational root of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients must be in the form of p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is -14 and the leading coefficient is 1. The factors of -14 are ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14. Since the leading coefficient is 1, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±7, and ±14. We can test these values to see if they are roots of the equation $a^5 - 4a^4 + 6a^3 - 6a^2 + a - 14 = 0$. By testing, we find that a = -2 is a root of the equation. Therefore, the equation $a^5 - 4a^4 + 6a^3 - 6a^2 + a - 14 = 0$ can be factored as $(a+2)(a^4 - 6a^2 + a - 7) = 0$. This equation has a root at a = -2. To find the other roots of the equation, we need to solve the equation a^4 - 6a^2 + a - 7 = 0. Unfortunately, this equation cannot be factored easily. However, we can use the quadratic formula to solve the equation. The quadratic formula is $",

We solve the equation $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 = 15$ for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}.$ We then substitute the values of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$ to get the possible values of $b^2$. We can then take the square root of $b^2$ to get $b$, and determine which one is the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$. Since we want the value of $b^2$ to be as large as possible, we test the values of $a$.

We see that $\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2}$ is the largest value, so we substitute this value of $a$ into the expression for $b^2$. This gives $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}{(\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{1}{2} -1)^2}.$ We can simplify this expression for $b^2$ to get $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (\\sqrt{15}-\\frac{3}{\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use calculus to find the maximum value of $b$ by taking the derivative of the expression for $b^2$ with respect to $a$ and setting it equal to zero.\n[Full step]:  We are given that $b^2 = \\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}$ and we want to maximize the value of $b$. To do this, we can take the derivative of $b^2$ with respect to $a$ and set it equal to zero to find the critical points. Differentiating the expression for $b^2$ with respect to $a$ gives $\\frac{d}{da}(b^2) = \\frac{d}{da}\\left(\\frac{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}{(a-1)^2}\\right) = \\frac{(a-1)^2\\cdot(-2(a^2-1)\\cdot2a) - (15 - (a^2-1)^2)\\cdot2(a-1)}{(a-1)^4}.$ We can simplify this expression to get $\\frac{-2(a^2-1)^2(a-1)-15+ (a^2-1)^2}{(a-1)^3}.$ We can factor out the common factor $(a^2-1)$ from the numerator to get $\\frac{(a^2-1)(-2(a^2-1)(a-1)-15+ (a^2-1))}{(a-1)^3}.$ This expression can be further simplified to $\\frac{(a^2-1)(-2a^3+3a^2-2a-15)}{(a-1)^3}.$ We can now set this expression equal to zero and solve for $a$ to find the critical points. Setting the numerator equal to zero gives $-2a^3+3a^2-2a-15 = 0.$ We can factor this equation as $(a+1)(2a^2-5a+15) = 0.$ The solutions to this equation are $a=-1$ and $a=\\frac{5\\pm \\sqrt{25-60}}{4} = \\frac{5\\pm i \\sqrt{35}}{4}$.

Taking the square root of both sides, we get $|b| = \\sqrt{15 - (a^2 -1)^2}.$ In order to maximize the imaginary part of $z$, we want to maximize $b$, which is the square root of the expression on the right-hand side. Therefore, we need to minimize the value of $(a^2 -1)^2$ in order to maximize the value of $15 - (a^2 -1)^2$. We see that $(a^2-1)^2$ is minimized when $a = 1$ or $a = -1$ since $a^2$ is a squared real number. Therefore, the maximum value of $|b|$ is $\\sqrt{15 - (-1-1)^2} = \\sqrt{15-4} = \\sqrt{11}.$\n\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\boxed{11+1}\n</step>\n</think>\n",

What is $m+n$?\n\nStep 1: <step>\n[Core idea]: Express the given condition as a polynomial equation and use the quadratic formula to find its roots.\n[Full step]: Let $z=a+bi$. Then, $|1+z+z^2| = 4$ is equivalent to $|1 + (a+bi) + (a^2+b^2i^2)| = 4$. Since $i^2 = -1$, this simplifies to $| (a^3 - a + 1) + b(1- a^2)i | = 4$. By definition of the absolute value of a complex number, this is equivalent to the equation $(a^3-a+1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 = 16$. Expanding gives $(a^6-2a^4+2a^2+1) + (1-2a^2)(b^2)+b^2a^4 = 16$, or $a^6 -2a^4 + 2a^2 + 1 + b^2 -2ab^2 + a^4b^2 = 16$, which simplifies to $a^6+ a^4b^2 -2a^4 + 2a^2 + b^2-2ab^2 = 15$, or $(a^4 - 2a^2 + 1) + b^2( a^2-2a + 1) = 15$. Factoring the first part of the equation, we get $(a^2 -1)^2 + b^2(a^2-2a+1) = 15$. Then, since $(a^2-1)^2 \\geq 0$ and $(a^2-2a+1) = (a-1)^2 \\geq 0$, we have $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\geq 0$. Therefore, $(a^2-1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\leq 15$. Since $(a^2-1)^2 \\geq 0$ and $(a-1)^2 \\geq 0$, we have $(a^2 -1)^2 + (a-1)^2b^2 \\leq 15$.

The given equation is $|1+z+z^2| = 4$, which is equivalent to $(a^3-a+1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 = 16$. The expression $(a^3-a+1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2$ is a sum of squares of real numbers, which is always non-negative. To maximize $b^2$, we want to minimize $(a^3-a+1)^2$ and $(1-a^2)^2$. We note that if $a=0$, then $(a^3-a+1)^2 = 1^2 = 1$ and $(1-a^2)^2 = 1^2 = 1$. However, this is not the minimum value of $(a^3-a+1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2$ because $b^2(1-a^2)^2 \\geq 0$ and $b^2 \\geq 0$ for all complex numbers $z$. Then the minimum value of the sum is achieved when $b^2(1-a^2)^2 = 0$. This is only possible when $b^2=0$ or $(1-a^2)^2=0$. Since $a^2 \\leq 1$, $a^2 \\leq 1$ and $a^4 \\leq a^2$. This implies that $(a^3-a+1)^2 + b^2(1-a^2)^2 \\geq (a^3-a+1)^2$. Now we need to minimize $(a^3-a+1)^2$. To find the minimum value of $(a^3-a+1)^2$, let $f(a) = (a^3-a+1)^2$. Then the derivative of $f(a)$ is $f'(a) = 6a^2 - 2a$. Setting $f'(a) = 0$ and solving for $a$, we get $a = \\frac{1}{3}$ or $a = 0$. The second derivative of $f(a)$ is $f''(a) = 12a - 2$.

By grouping and rearranging, we get $(a^4 - 2a^2 + 1) + b^2(a^2 - 2a + 1) = 15$. Completing the square, we have $(a^2 - 1)^2 + b^2(a - 1)^2 = 15$. Let $a - 1 = x$ and $b^2 = y^2$. Then, we have $x^2 + y^2 = 16$. We can rewrite this equation as $y^2 = 16 - x^2$. We want to find the maximum value of $y$, which is the imaginary part of $z$. Since $y^2 = 16 - x^2$, we can see that $y^2$ is a quadratic function of $x$. The maximum value of $y^2$ occurs when $x^2 = 0$, which gives $y^2 = 16$. Therefore, the maximum value of $y$ is $\\sqrt{16} = 4$.\n\nSince $z = a + bi$, the imaginary part of $z$ is $b = y$.
