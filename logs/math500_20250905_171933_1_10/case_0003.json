However, we cannot directly substitute x = -2 because it will result in division by zero. We need to find the limit of f(x) as x approaches -2, which we can do by factoring the numerator and cancelling out the common factor. We have f(x) = \\frac{3x-2}{x-2} = \\frac{3(x-2/3)}{x-2}. Therefore, as x approaches -2, f(x) approaches \\frac{3(-2-2/3)}{-2-2} = \\frac{-8/3}{-4} = \\frac{2}{3}.
