To find the angle $\\theta$, take the inverse tangent (arctangent) of both sides, giving $\\theta = \\arctan \\left( \\frac{5}{7} \\right)$.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Consider the relationship between the slopes and the angle, using the properties of right triangles and the definitions of slope.\n[Full step]:  From the given slopes $m_1 = 2$ and $m_2 = \\frac{1}{3}$, we can draw a right triangle with legs of length 1, representing the rise and run for each line. The angle between the lines forms a vertical angle with the vertical angle of the right triangle formed by the lines. This right triangle is similar to the triangle formed by the lines and the x-axis. By recognizing the relationship between the slopes and the sides of the triangle, we can express the angle in terms of the inverse tangent of a ratio of the sides of the triangle. The hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the lines and the x-axis can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which gives a hypotenuse length of $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5}$ for the first line and $\\sqrt{1^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{9}}$ for the second line. Then, we can find the cotangent of the angle by taking the ratio of the lengths of the legs to the hypotenuse, which gives $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ for the first line and $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{10}{9}}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{10}}$ for the second line. Since we are looking for the acute angle, we need to find the inverse cotangent of the ratio of the two cotangents. However, we realize that the correct method is to use the formula for the tangent of the angle between two lines, which we already calculated in the previous step as $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{5}{7}$. Therefore, we can use the inverse tangent of this value to find the angle $\\theta$.\n</step>\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\boxed{arctan(5/7)}.\n</think>\n"

The angle between the lines forms a vertical angle with the vertical angle of the right triangle formed by the lines. This right triangle is similar to the triangle formed by the lines and the x-axis. By recognizing the relationship between the slopes and the sides of the triangle, we can express the angle in terms of the inverse tangent of a ratio of the sides of the triangle. The hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the lines and the x-axis can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which gives a hypotenuse length of $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5}$ for the first line and $\\sqrt{1^2 + \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{9}}$ for the second line.

Since we are looking for the acute angle, we need to find the inverse cotangent of the ratio of the two cotangents. However, we realize that the correct method is to use the formula for the tangent of the angle between two lines, which we already calculated in the previous step as $\\tan \\theta = \\frac{5}{7}$.
