Therefore, the total weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza and $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{7}{8}$ pounds. Similarly, the total weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza and $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices is $\\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{8}$ pounds. As per the given information, we have the equation $\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{8}$.\n</step>\nStep 2: <step>\n[Core idea]: Rearrange the equation to express x in terms of the given weights of orange slices and solve for x.\n[Full step]: To find the weight of a large pizza, we need to solve the equation $\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{8}$. To isolate x, we'll first subtract $\\frac{1}{3}x$ from both sides to get $\\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}x - \\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{8}$. This simplifies to $\\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{4}{12}x + \\frac{4}{24}x$. Combine the fractions on the right-hand side by finding a common denominator, which is 24. This gives us $\\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{8}{24}x + \\frac{1}{4}x = \\frac{6}{24}x + \\frac{6}{24}x = \\frac{12}{24}x$. To isolate x, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of $\\frac{12}{24}$, which is $\\frac{24}{12}$, giving us $\\frac{7}{8} \\cdot \\frac{24}{12} = x$. This simplifies to $\\frac{7}{6} = x$. Therefore, the weight of a large pizza is $\\frac{7}{6}$ pounds.\n\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\boxed{1}\n</step>\n</think>\n",

      "full_reasoning_path": "Question: The weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza together with $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is the same as the weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza together with $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices. A cup of orange slices weighs $\\frac{1}{4}$ of a pound. What is the weight, in pounds, of a large pizza? The answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m-n$?\n\nStep 1: <step>\n[Core idea]: Let's represent the weight of a large pizza as 'x' pounds.\n[Full step]: Let x be the weight of a large pizza in pounds. The weight of a large pizza with $\\frac{1}{3}$ of it is $\\frac{1}{3}x$. The weight of $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $\\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{7}{8}$ pounds. Therefore, the total weight of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a large pizza and $3 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of orange slices is $\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{7}{8}$ pounds. Similarly, the total weight of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a large pizza and $\\frac{1}{2}$ cup of orange slices is $\\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{8}$ pounds. As per the given information, we have the equation $\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{8}$.\n</step>\nStep 2: <step>\n[Core idea]: Add $\\frac{1}{8}$ to both sides and then multiply both sides by 24 to eliminate the fractions and then isolate x.\n[Full step]: In order to get rid of the fractions, we can add $\\frac{1}{8}$ to both sides, resulting in $\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{7}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{4}$. Multiplying both sides by 24 gets rid of the fractions: $24\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 24\\left(\\frac{3}{4}x + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$. This simplifies to $8x + 12 = 18x + 6$. Subtracting $8x$ from both sides gives us $12 = 10x + 6$. Subtracting 6 from both sides gives us $6 = 10x$. Finally, dividing both sides by 10 gives us $x = \\frac{6}{10}$, which can be simplified to $x = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\boxed{3-5}\n</step>\n</think>\n",
