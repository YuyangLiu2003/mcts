[Core idea]: Find the prime factorization of 196
[Full step]: To find the prime factorization of 196, we start by dividing 196 by the smallest prime number, 2. Since 196 is even, we can divide it by 2 to get 98. We repeat the process by dividing 98 by 2, which gives us 49. 49 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3. However, 49 is not divisible by 3, so we move to the next prime number, which is 7. 49 is divisible by 7, giving us 7. Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is 2^2 * 7^2.

[Full step]:
------------------------------expand_response------------------------------
 Since the prime factorization of 196 is 2^2 * 7^2, we can use the formula (a+1)(b+1) to find the number of divisors. In this case, a = 2 and b = 2. Therefore, the number of divisors is (2+1)(2+1) = 3 * 3 = 9.

------------------------------expand_response------------------------------
 To count the number of divisors of 196, we can use the prime factorization we found earlier, which is 2^2 * 7^2. To find the total number of divisors, we add 1 to each exponent in the prime factorization and multiply the results together. In this case, we have (2+1) * (2+1) = 3 * 3 = 9. Therefore, the total number of divisors of 196 is 9.
</step>

[Check terminal]
The final answer to the question is \boxed{9}.
------------------------------expand_response------------------------------
 Since the prime factorization of 196 is 2^2 * 7^2, we can find the total number of divisors by multiplying the number of divisors for each prime factor. For 2^2, the number of divisors is 2 + 1 = 3 (2^0, 2^1, and 2^2). For 7^2, the number of divisors is 2 + 1 = 3 (7^0 and 7^1). Therefore, the total number of divisors is 3 * 3 = 9.

[Check terminal]
The final answer to the question is \boxed{9}.
