[Core idea]: Convert the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$
[Full step]: To convert the point $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates, we need to find the distance $r$ from the origin to the point and the angle $\theta$ that the line connecting the origin and the point makes with the positive x-axis. The distance $r$ can be found using the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},$ and the angle $\theta$ can be found using the formula $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$ Since the given point is $(0, 3),$ we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3.$ Substituting these values into the formulas, we get $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3,$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)}.$ However, since the point lies on the positive y-axis, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ because it forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis.

  Since the point $(0,3)$ lies on the positive y-axis, we can directly assign an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to it, as it forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis. This is a special case where the arctan function is not needed because we can determine the angle based on the coordinate values and the position of the point in the coordinate plane.

[Check terminal]: The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3,\frac{\pi}{2})}.

------------------------------expand_response------------------------------
 Since we have a problem with the arctan function at x = 0 (division by zero), we need to consider the case when x = 0, and y > 0, which corresponds to the point being on the positive y-axis. In this case, the angle θ will be π/2 because the point forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis. This is a special case that needs to be handled separately. The correct polar coordinates are (r, θ) = (3, π/2).
</step>

[Check terminal]: The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.
------------------------------expand_response------------------------------
 We observe that the point $(0,3)$ lies on the positive y-axis. The equation of the unit circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 1.$ Since the point is on the y-axis, we can substitute $x=0$ into the equation, resulting in $0^2 + y^2 = 1,$ which simplifies to $y^2 = 1.$ This implies that $y = \pm 1.$ However, since the point is at $y = 3,$ we can conclude that the point is actually at a distance of 3 from the origin in the positive y-direction, which means the polar coordinate is $(3, \frac{\pi}{2}).$
</step>

[Check terminal]
The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}.
