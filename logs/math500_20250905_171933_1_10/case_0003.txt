[Core idea]: We need to find the value of f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) by first finding the function values at these points.
[Full step]: To find the value of f(-2), we substitute x = -2 into the function f(x) = \frac{3x-2}{x-2}. However, we cannot directly substitute x = -2 because it will result in division by zero. We need to find the limit of f(x) as x approaches -2, which we can do by factoring the numerator and cancelling out the common factor. We have f(x) = \frac{3x-2}{x-2} = \frac{3(x-2/3)}{x-2}. Therefore, as x approaches -2, f(x) approaches \frac{3(-2-2/3)}{-2-2} = \frac{-8/3}{-4} = \frac{2}{3}. Similarly, we can find the value of f(-1) by substituting x = -1 into the function f(x) = \frac{3x-2}{x-2} = \frac{3(-1)-2}{-1-2} = \frac{-5}{-3} = \frac{5}{3}. For f(0), we have f(0) = \frac{3(0) - 2}{0-2} = \frac{-2}{-2} = 1.

[Core idea]: Simplify the expression of f(x) to a different form that makes it easier to evaluate f(-2), f(-1), and f(0).
[Full step]:
------------------------------expand_response------------------------------
 We can rewrite f(x) as f(x) = \frac{3x-2}{x-2} = \frac{3x-2+2-2}{x-2} = \frac{(3x-2)+(-2)}{x-2} = \frac{3(x-2/3)+2(3/3)}{x-2} = \frac{3(x-2/3)}{x-2} + \frac{2(1)}{x-2} = 3 + \frac{2}{x-2}. This new form makes it easier to evaluate f(-2), f(-1), and f(0).

[Core idea]: Simplify the expression of f(x) to a different form that makes it easier to evaluate f(-2), f(-1), and f(0).
[Full step]: We can rewrite f(x) as f(x) = \frac{3x-2}{x-2} = \frac{3x-2+2-2}{x-2} = \frac{(3x-2)+(-2)}{x-2} = \frac{3(x-2/3)+2(3/3)}{x-2} = \frac{3(x-2/3)}{x-2} + \frac{2(1)}{x-2} = 3 + \frac{2}{x-2}. This new form makes it easier to evaluate f(-2), f(-1), and f(0).
</step>
------------------------------expand_response------------------------------
 We have already found the values of f(-2), f(-1), and f(0) in the previous steps. Now, we can simply add these values to find the sum: f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{3} + 1. To add these fractions, we need to have the same denominator, which is 3. Therefore, f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{10}{3}.

Error processing case 3: unterminated character set at position 10

We already found the value of f(0) as 1. For f(-1), we have f(-1) = \frac{3(-1)-2}{-1-2} = \frac{-5}{-3} = \frac{5}{3}. For f(-2), we used the limit approach in the previous step to find the value as \frac{2}{3}. Now, we can find the sum of these values: f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{3} + 1 = \frac{2+5+3}{3} = \frac{10}{3}.
