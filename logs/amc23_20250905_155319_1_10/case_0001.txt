<step>
[Core idea]: Find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth to determine the time it takes for them to meet and then use that time to find the distance from City A.
[Full step]: To find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, we add their speeds together, since they are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. This combined speed will be the rate at which the distance between them decreases over time.

 To find the distance from City A where they will meet, we'll use the formula distance = speed * time. Since they are moving towards each other, we can treat their combined speed as the rate of their approach. The time it takes for them to meet can be calculated using the formula time = distance / combined speed. Given that the distance between the cities is 45 miles and their combined speed is 30 mph, the time it takes for them to meet is 45 miles / 30 mph = 1.5 hours. Using this time, we can find the distance from City A to the meeting point by calculating the distance traveled by Alicia in this time, which is 18 mph * 1.5 hours = 27 miles.

 Let's denote the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet as t hours. The distance between them decreases at a rate of 30 mph, so the distance between them after t hours will be 45 - 30t. Since they meet after t hours, the distance between them is 0. So we set up the equation 45 - 30t = 0 and solve for t. Dividing both sides by -30, we get t = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours. Now that we know the time, we can find the distance from City A by multiplying the combined speed of 30 mph by the time 1.5 hours, which gives us 30 * 1.5 = 45 miles. However, this is incorrect. The correct distance is the distance that Alicia traveled in 1.5 hours, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.

To determine if we've found the final answer, let's analyze the problem statement and our current step. We have determined the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet, and we have used this time to find the distance from City A. However, we still need to consider whether this distance is the one we are looking for. Based on the problem, it seems like the question is asking for the total distance they will be from City A when they meet, which is the distance we found. However, to be certain, let's verify if there's any other information we need to consider or if this step is indeed the final step.

Since we have followed the problem statement and have a clear answer, we can proceed to the final answer.

Question: Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet?

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth to determine the time it takes for them to meet and then use that time to find the distance from City A.
[Full step]: To find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, we add their speeds together, since they are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. This combined speed will be the rate at which the distance between them decreases over time.
</step>
Step 2: <step>

The distance between them decreases at a rate of 30 mph, so the distance between them after t hours will be 45 - 30t. Since they meet after t hours, the distance between them is 0.

Now that we know the time, we can find the distance from City A by multiplying the combined speed of 30 mph by the time 1.5 hours, which gives us 30 * 1.5 = 45 miles. However, this is incorrect. The correct distance is the distance that Alicia traveled in 1.5 hours, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.

 The current step is incomplete and contains an error. It correctly finds the time t at which Alicia and Beth meet but incorrectly calculates the distance from City A. The correct approach should be to find the distance traveled by Alicia in t hours, which is her speed multiplied by t.

 The step is attempting to use the concept of relative motion to solve the problem. However, it has a major flaw in calculating the time. The time it takes for them to meet is correctly calculated as 45 miles / 30 mph = 1.5 hours. However, it does not directly calculate the distance from City A where they will meet. Instead, it incorrectly assumes that the distance traveled by Alicia is the distance from City A to the meeting point. This is incorrect because Beth also travels the same distance, and the meeting point is the point where their paths intersect, which is not necessarily the same as the distance traveled by Alicia. To calculate the distance from City A, we need to divide the total distance by 2, as they are approaching each other.

Question: Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet?

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth to determine the time it takes for them to meet and then use that time to find the distance from City A.
[Full step]: To find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, we add their speeds together, since they are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. This combined speed will be the rate at which the distance between them decreases over time.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Calculate the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the initial distance by their combined speed, then use this time to find the distance from City A by multiplying it with Alicia's speed.
[Full step]: Now that we know their combined speed is 30 mph, we can find the time it takes for them to meet by dividing the initial distance of 45 miles by their combined speed of 30 mph. This gives us t = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours. We can use this time to find the distance from City A that they will be when they meet by multiplying it with Alicia's speed of 18 mph. This gives us distance = 1.5 * 18 = 27 miles.

 The step has two issues. Firstly, it does not mention that the distance they will be from City A when they meet is the difference between the initial distance and the distance they have covered, which is a crucial point to note. Secondly, the calculation of the time it takes for them to meet is correct, but it does not explicitly mention that this time is the same for both Alicia and Beth, and it glosses over the fact that the time calculated is not the time it takes for them to meet, but rather the time it takes for the distance between them to be 0, and that the actual distance from City A when they meet is the distance covered by Alicia or Beth in that time.

Question: Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet?

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth to determine the time it takes for them to meet and then use that time to find the distance from City A.
[Full step]: To find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, we add their speeds together, since they are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. This combined speed will be the rate at which the distance between them decreases over time.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Use the formula distance = rate * time to find the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet, then find the distance from City A using this time and their combined speed.
[Full step]: Let's denote the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet as t hours. The distance between them decreases at a rate of 30 mph, so the distance between them after t hours will be 45 - 30t. Since they meet after t hours, the distance between them is 0. So we set up the equation 45 - 30t = 0 and solve for t. Dividing both sides by -30, we get t = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours. Now that we know the time, we can find the distance from City A by multiplying the combined speed of 30 mph by the time 1.5 hours, which gives us 30 * 1.5 = 45 miles. However, this is incorrect. The correct distance is the distance that Alicia traveled in 1.5 hours, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.


The final answer to the question is \boxed{27}

 The solution provided is generally correct in its approach but has some issues with the calculation and interpretation of the result. The solution correctly identifies the combined speed of Alicia and Beth and uses it to find the time it takes for them to meet. However, it incorrectly calculates the distance from City A when they meet. The solution states that the distance from City A is the distance that Alicia traveled in 1.5 hours, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles. However, this is not the distance from City A when they meet. The correct distance from City A is the distance that Alicia traveled in 1.5 hours, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles. However, to find the distance from City A, we need to find the distance that Alicia traveled, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles, and then subtract this distance from the total distance between the cities, which is 45 miles. So the correct distance from City A is 45 - 27 = 18 miles. The solution also does not check if the conditions of the problem are met, such as if the time it takes for them to meet is physically possible, given their speeds.

Question: Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet?

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth to determine the time it takes for them to meet and then use that time to find the distance from City A.
[Full step]: To find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, we add their speeds together, since they are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. This combined speed will be the rate at which the distance between them decreases over time.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Apply the concept of relative motion to find the meeting point, considering the initial distance and their speeds as they move towards each other.
[Full step]: To find the distance from City A where they will meet, we'll use the formula distance = speed * time. Since they are moving towards each other, we can treat their combined speed as the rate of their approach. The time it takes for them to meet can be calculated using the formula time = distance / combined speed. Given that the distance between the cities is 45 miles and their combined speed is 30 mph, the time it takes for them to meet is 45 miles / 30 mph = 1.5 hours. Using this time, we can find the distance from City A to the meeting point by calculating the distance traveled by Alicia in this time, which is 18 mph * 1.5 hours = 27 miles.

 The solution is well-structured and easy to follow. It starts by identifying the problem and the key information given, which is the distance between the cities and the speeds of Alicia and Beth. It then calculates the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, which is a crucial step in solving the problem. However, the solution doesn't explicitly state the final answer in the format requested, instead of putting it in a box. The final answer is correctly calculated as 27 miles, which is the distance from City A where they will meet.

The solution also correctly uses the formula distance = speed * time, which is a fundamental concept in physics and is applicable to this problem. However, it would be better if the solution explicitly stated the final answer in a box as requested.

Overall, the solution is clear, concise, and correctly solves the problem. However, it doesn't meet the requested format to the letter.

 Both Step A and Step B aim to find the distance from City A where Alicia and Beth will meet. However, Step A has a critical error in the calculation of the distance from City A. It incorrectly calculates the distance from City A by using the combined speed of 30 mph, which is the combined speed of both Alicia and Beth. This results in an incorrect answer of 45 miles. On the other hand, Step B correctly identifies the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet and uses this time to calculate the distance from City A by considering the speed of Alicia only. This approach correctly yields the answer of 27 miles.

In terms of the process criterion 1 (obvious errors), Step A has a significant error in its calculation, while Step B is error-free. For process criterion 2 (helping to solve the question), both steps provide a clear solution to the problem, but Step B's approach is more accurate and straightforward.

 Let's compare the two steps in meeting the process criterions.

1. Does it help solve the question?
   - Step A: Although Step A has the correct final answer, it contains an error in its calculation process. It incorrectly calculates the distance by multiplying the combined speed by the time, instead of using Alicia's speed. The presence of this error makes the step less reliable and less helpful in solving the question.
   - Step B: Step B correctly identifies the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet by dividing the initial distance by their combined speed. Then, it uses this time to find the distance from City A by multiplying it with Alicia's speed, which is the correct approach. Therefore, Step B is more helpful in solving the question.

2. Is there any obvious error?
   - Step A: As mentioned earlier, Step A contains an obvious error in its calculation process. It incorrectly multiplies the combined speed by the time, resulting in an incorrect answer.
   - Step B: Step B does not contain any obvious errors and follows a clear and correct calculation process.

Based on the analysis, Step B is a more reliable and helpful step in solving the question, as it correctly calculates the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet and then uses this time to find the correct distance from City A.

 Comparing the two steps in detail, we can see that both steps follow a similar approach to solve the problem. However, there are some subtle differences in their presentation and clarity. Step A explicitly mentions "apply the concept of relative motion" and "treating their combined speed as the rate of their approach", which shows a good understanding of the underlying physics concept. It also clearly explains the calculation process, using the formula distance = speed * time and time = distance / combined speed. The language used in Step A is a bit more formal and precise, which makes it easier to follow.

On the other hand, Step B's language is a bit more casual and concise, but it might make the problem seem more straightforward, which can potentially lead to oversimplification. Although both steps arrive at the same answer, the presentation in Step A is more detailed and transparent.

[Score]: 2 (Step A is slightly better than Step B due to its more formal and precise language, which makes the problem-solving process easier to follow.)

Question: Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet?

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth to determine the time it takes for them to meet and then use that time to find the distance from City A.
[Full step]: To find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, we add their speeds together, since they are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. This combined speed will be the rate at which the distance between them decreases over time.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Use the formula distance = rate * time to find the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet, then find the distance from City A using this time and their combined speed.
[Full step]: Let's denote the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet as t hours. The distance between them decreases at a rate of 30 mph, so the distance between them after t hours will be 45 - 30t. Since they meet after t hours, the distance between them is 0. So we set up the equation 45 - 30t = 0 and solve for t. Dividing both sides by -30, we get t = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours. Now that we know the time, we can find the distance from City A by multiplying the combined speed of 30 mph by the time 1.5 hours, which gives us 30 * 1.5 = 45 miles. However, this is incorrect. The correct distance is the distance that Alicia traveled in 1.5 hours, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.


The final answer to the question is \boxed{27}

 The solution provided is mostly correct in its reasoning and approach. It correctly identifies the combined speed of Alicia and Beth and uses it to find the time it takes for them to meet. However, the final step of finding the distance from City A is incorrect. The solution mistakenly calculates the combined distance traveled by both Alicia and Beth, instead of the distance traveled by Alicia alone. The correct approach is to find the distance traveled by Alicia, which is her speed multiplied by the time, as the problem asks for the distance from City A where they meet, and Alicia is the one from City A.

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth to determine the time it takes for them to meet and then use that time to find the distance from City A.
[Full step]: To find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, we add their speeds together, since they are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. This combined speed will be the rate at which the distance between them decreases over time.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Apply the concept of relative motion to find the meeting point, considering the initial distance and their speeds as they move towards each other.
[Full step]: To find the distance from City A where they will meet, we'll use the formula distance = speed * time. Since they are moving towards each other, we can treat their combined speed as the rate of their approach. The time it takes for them to meet can be calculated using the formula time = distance / combined speed. Given that the distance between the cities is 45 miles and their combined speed is 30 mph, the time it takes for them to meet is 45 miles / 30 mph = 1.5 hours. Using this time, we can find the distance from City A to the meeting point by calculating the distance traveled by Alicia in this time, which is 18 mph * 1.5 hours = 27 miles.

 The solution is mostly correct and well-structured but lacks in clarity. The step-by-step approach is clear, and the use of the formula distance = speed * time is appropriate. However, the solution does not explicitly state its reasoning for using the time calculated (1.5 hours) to find the distance from City A. Also, the solution assumes that both Alicia and Beth would have traveled the same distance when they meet, which is a valid assumption in this scenario.

The solution does not violate any known conditions and the answer (27 miles) is correct.

The format is clear, but there is no final numerical evaluation. A detailed numerical evaluation is necessary to conclude on the correctness of the solution.

 The solution is mostly correct but not perfectly done. It follows a logical step-by-step approach to solve the problem, but there are some minor issues. The main problem is that the solution incorrectly identifies the distance from City A where Alicia and Beth will meet. The correct calculation should be the distance that Alicia traveled in 1.5 hours, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles, but the explanation could be clearer and more concise.

Question: Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet?

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth to determine the time it takes for them to meet and then use that time to find the distance from City A.
[Full step]: To find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, we add their speeds together, since they are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. This combined speed will be the rate at which the distance between them decreases over time.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Apply the concept of relative motion to find the meeting point, considering the initial distance and their speeds as they move towards each other.
[Full step]: To find the distance from City A where they will meet, we'll use the formula distance = speed * time. Since they are moving towards each other, we can treat their combined speed as the rate of their approach. The time it takes for them to meet can be calculated using the formula time = distance / combined speed. Given that the distance between the cities is 45 miles and their combined speed is 30 mph, the time it takes for them to meet is 45 miles / 30 mph = 1.5 hours. Using this time, we can find the distance from City A to the meeting point by calculating the distance traveled by Alicia in this time, which is 18 mph * 1.5 hours = 27 miles.


The final answer to the question is \boxed{27}

 The solution appears to be on the right track by considering the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, but it seems to be missing some steps and does not fully utilize the distance-speed-time relationship. The solution jumps directly to calculating the time and distance without explaining how it is used to find the meeting point, which is the main question. Furthermore, the correct distance to the meeting point is not explicitly calculated using the time, but it is mentioned as if it is a given fact. The solution also does not address the critical point of using the time to find the meeting point on the distance scale between the two cities.

[Full step]: To find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, we add their speeds together, since they are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. This combined speed will be the rate at which the distance between them decreases over time.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Use the formula distance = rate * time to find the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet, then find the distance from City A using this time and their combined speed.
[Full step]: Let's denote the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet as t hours. The distance between them decreases at a rate of 30 mph, so the distance between them after t hours will be 45 - 30t. Since they meet after t hours, the distance between them is 0. So we set up the equation 45 - 30t = 0 and solve for t. Dividing both sides by -30, we get t = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours. Now that we know the time, we can find the distance from City A by multiplying the combined speed of 30 mph by the time 1.5 hours, which gives us 30 * 1.5 = 45 miles. However, this is incorrect. The correct distance is the distance that Alicia traveled in 1.5 hours, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.

 The solution appears to be correct in its analysis and steps, but it contains a critical mistake in the final calculation. The solution correctly identifies the combined speed and calculates the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet. However, when calculating the distance from City A, it incorrectly calculates the total distance instead of the distance traveled by Alicia. This mistake significantly affects the accuracy of the solution. Furthermore, the solution could benefit from a more detailed and structured explanation of the steps, particularly in the final calculation. Additionally, the solution could explicitly state the final answer in the required format. Despite these issues, the solution demonstrates a good understanding of the problem and the underlying concepts.

 The solution is well-structured and attempts to solve the problem step by step. However, there are some issues with the final answer. The solution claims that the distance from City A when Alicia and Beth meet is 45 miles, which is incorrect because if they meet after 1.5 hours, they would have covered 45 miles in total. However, the solution correctly calculates that Alicia traveled 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles. This indicates a partial understanding of the problem, but the final answer is still incorrect.

As for the format, the solution follows the required format for the most part but lacks some clarity in the steps and does not provide a clear conclusion.

 The solution is mostly correct in its approach, but there are some minor mistakes and inconsistencies. The initial step correctly identifies the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, and the second step correctly finds the time it takes for them to meet using the formula distance = rate * time. However, the solution incorrectly calculates the distance from City A by multiplying the combined speed by the time, which is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that Alicia and Beth are traveling towards each other, and the distance they cover is not the same as the combined speed times time. The correct distance is Alicia's speed times the time it takes for her to meet Beth, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles. Additionally, the final answer is written in a separate line, which is not in line with the required format.

 The solution presented has some issues. The formula distance = rate * time is applied correctly, but the interpretation of the time and distance is incorrect. The original solution incorrectly calculates the distance from City A when Alicia and Beth meet. The correct approach is to find the distance traveled by Alicia in 1.5 hours, which is 18 miles per hour * 1.5 hours = 27 miles. The solution does not clearly explain why the combined speed is not used to find the distance from City A. The answer provided is correct, but the reasoning is flawed.

 The solution is mostly correct but has one major flaw. It correctly identifies the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, and uses the distance = rate * time formula to find the time it takes for them to meet. However, it incorrectly calculates the distance from City A when they meet. The correct distance should be the distance that Alicia traveled in the time it takes for them to meet, not the combined distance they traveled. The solution also has a minor issue with the final step, where it states that the distance is 45 miles, which is the initial distance between the cities, and then correctly states the distance as 27 miles, but does not clearly explain why it is the correct distance.

Question: Cities $A$ and $B$ are $45$ miles apart. Alicia lives in $A$ and Beth lives in $B$. Alicia bikes towards $B$ at 18 miles per hour. Leaving at the same time, Beth bikes toward $A$ at 12 miles per hour. How many miles from City $A$ will they be when they meet?

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth to determine the time it takes for them to meet and then use that time to find the distance from City A.
[Full step]: To find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, we add their speeds together, since they are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. This combined speed will be the rate at which the distance between them decreases over time.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Use the formula distance = rate * time to find the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet, then find the distance from City A using this time and their combined speed.
[Full step]: Let's denote the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet as t hours. The distance between them decreases at a rate of 30 mph, so the distance between them after t hours will be 45 - 30t. Since they meet after t hours, the distance between them is 0. So we set up the equation 45 - 30t = 0 and solve for t. Dividing both sides by -30, we get t = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours. Now that we know the time, we can find the distance from City A by multiplying the combined speed of 30 mph by the time 1.5 hours, which gives us 30 * 1.5 = 45 miles. However, this is incorrect. The correct distance is the distance that Alicia traveled in 1.5 hours, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.


The final answer to the question is \boxed{27}

 The solution is mostly clear and straightforward. However, there are a couple of issues. Firstly, the solution doesn't explicitly state the main objective of the problem, which is to find how many miles from City A they will be when they meet. Secondly, the final answer is stated as 27 miles, but it is incorrect; the correct answer is not provided in the solution. The solution does not follow the format requested for the answer, which is to strictly provide the final answer in a box, without any text or explanation. Furthermore, the solution does not explain why the distance traveled by Alicia is the correct answer, it just states it as a fact.

 The solution is good in that it starts with a clear description of the problem and the main concept to be used (combined speed). It also calculates the combined speed correctly. However, there are two main issues: 
1. The solution seems to be a mix of the original thought process and a rewritten version of the solution. This can be confusing to read and is not in line with the required format. 
2. The solution does not clearly solve the problem as initially stated. The final answer is actually the distance Alicia traveled, not how many miles from City A they will be when they meet. The correct solution should calculate the time it takes for them to meet and then use that time to find the distance from City A, which is 27 miles.

[Core idea]: Find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth to determine the time it takes for them to meet and then use that time to find the distance from City A.
[Full step]: To find the combined speed of Alicia and Beth, we add their speeds together, since they are moving towards each other. Their combined speed is 18 mph + 12 mph = 30 mph. This combined speed will be the rate at which the distance between them decreases over time.
</step>
------------------------------reasoning_step------------------------------
- <step>
[Core idea]: Use the formula distance = rate * time to find the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet, then find the distance from City A using this time and their combined speed.
[Full step]: Let's denote the time it takes for Alicia and Beth to meet as t hours. The distance between them decreases at a rate of 30 mph, so the distance between them after t hours will be 45 - 30t. Since they meet after t hours, the distance between them is 0. So we set up the equation 45 - 30t = 0 and solve for t. Dividing both sides by -30, we get t = 45 / 30 = 1.5 hours. Now that we know the time, we can find the distance from City A by multiplying the combined speed of 30 mph by the time 1.5 hours, which gives us 30 * 1.5 = 45 miles. However, this is incorrect. The correct distance is the distance that Alicia traveled in 1.5 hours, which is 18 * 1.5 = 27 miles.
