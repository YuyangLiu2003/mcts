Since 196 is even, we can divide it by 2 to get 98. We repeat the process by dividing 98 by 2, which gives us 49. 49 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3. However, 49 is not divisible by 3, so we move to the next prime number, which is 7. 49 is divisible by 7, giving us 7. Therefore, the prime factorization of 196 is 2^2 * 7^2.\n</step>",
