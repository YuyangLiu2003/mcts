[Core idea]: To find the smallest positive perfect cube that can be written as the sum of three consecutive integers, we need to start by listing out the first few perfect cubes and checking if they can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers.
[Full step]: List the first few perfect cubes: 1^3 = 1, 2^3 = 8, 3^3 = 27, 4^3 = 64, 5^3 = 125, 6^3 = 216, 7^3 = 343, 8^3 = 512, 9^3 = 729. Now we will check the cubes if they can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers.

Given the context above, provide 3 distinct andc diverse core ideas for the next reasoning step. Make sure these ideas explore different approaches or directions. If the conditions are sufficient, consider requesting to finish the solution and return the final answer. Note that we only need concise core ideas without full steps.

[1]: Analyze the pattern of consecutive integers and their sums to find a general formula for the sum of three consecutive integers.
[2]: Test if there's a known property or identity that relates perfect cubes to the sum of consecutive integers.
[3]: Start with the smallest possible consecutive integers and check if their sum is a perfect cube, then increment the integers and recheck until a perfect cube is found.
