We can see that the terms are alternating between being cubed numbers and subtracting cubed numbers. To simplify this expression, we can use the sum of cubes formula, which is: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. Since the given expression is an alternating sum of cubes, we can pair the terms as follows: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + ... + (18^3 - 17^3)$. Then we can simplify each pair using the sum of cubes formula.\n</step>\nStep 2: <step>\n[Core idea]: Consider using the properties of arithmetic sequences to simplify the expression, noting that the terms are in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.\n[Full step]:  Since the terms in the expression are in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term. However, we are given an alternating sum of cubes, so we cannot directly apply this formula. Instead, we can rearrange the terms to form two sequences: the terms where the exponent is odd (2, 4, 6, ..., 18) and the terms where the exponent is even (1, 3, 5, ..., 17). Each of these sequences is an arithmetic sequence, so we can find the sum of each sequence separately using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Then, we can subtract the sum of the even-exponent sequence from the sum of the odd-exponent sequence to get our final answer.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Apply the sum of cubes formula directly to each pair of consecutive terms in the expression, and then look for simplifications by combining like terms.\n[Full step]:  Now, let's apply the sum of cubes formula to each pair of terms in the expression: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + (8^3 - 7^3) + (10^3 - 9^3) + (12^3 - 11^3) + (14^3 - 13^3) + (16^3 - 15^3) + (18^3 - 17^3)$. Using the sum of cubes formula, we get: $(2-1)((2)^2 + 2*2 + (1)^2) + (4-3)((4)^2 + 4*4 + (3)^2) + (6-5)((6)^2 + 6*6 + (5)^2) + (8-7)((8)^2 + 8*8 + (7)^2) + (10-9)((10)^2 + 10*10 + (9)^2) + (12-11)((12)^2 + 12*12 + (11)^2) + (14-13)((14)^2 + 14*14 + (13)^2) + (16-15)((16)^2 + 16*16 + (15)^2) + (18-17)((18)^2 + 18*18 + (17)^2)$.

Similarly, for the second pair, we have $4^3 - 3^3 = (4 - 3)(4^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 + 3^2) = 1(16 + 12 + 9) = 37$. We can continue this process for each pair. After applying the formula to all pairs, we have $7 + 37 + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$. We need to find the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes to telescope the series.\n[Full step]: We notice that the difference between consecutive cubes follows a pattern: $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = n^3 - (n^3 - 3n^2 + 3n - 1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$. Applying this pattern to each pair of terms in the given expression, we get $(2^3 - 1^3) = (3 \\cdot 2^2 - 3 \\cdot 2 + 1) = 9 - 6 + 1 = 4$, $(4^3 - 3^3) = (3 \\cdot 4^2 - 3 \\cdot 4 + 1) = 48 - 12 + 1 = 37$, $(6^3 - 5^3) = (3 \\cdot 6^2 - 3 \\cdot 6 + 1) = 108 - 18 + 1 = 91$, and so on. We can continue this process for all pairs of terms. Notice that we have a difference of squares in the form of $(2n-1)^2$ in the middle of the expression, so we can expand these squares to simplify the expression further. By telescoping the series, we can simplify the given expression as the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the difference of cubes formula to simplify each pair of terms and then analyze the resulting series.\n[Full step]: Now let's apply the difference of cubes formula to each pair of terms and simplify them. This will give us $2^3 - 1^3 = (2-1)((2^2)+(2\\cdot 1)+(1^2))$, $4^3 - 3^3 = (4-3)((4^2)+(4\\cdot 3)+(3^2))$, $6^3 - 5^3 = (6-5)((6^2)+(6\\cdot 5)+(5^2))$, and so on. We can write these out in a more general form. We'll have $(2n-1)((2n-1)^2+(2n-1)(n)+(n^2))$. To simplify this, we can expand the squared term and the second term, then combine like terms. After this, we can factor out the common $(2n-1)$ from each term to get a simpler expression for each pair. This will allow us to telescope the series and evaluate the sum of all the terms more easily.\n</step>\n"

We can recognize that this is similar to the difference of squares formula, where $(n^2 - 1) = (n - 1)(n + 1)$. However, in this case, we are multiplying by 3, so we can't directly apply the difference of squares formula. Instead, we can use the fact that $(n^2 - 1) = (n - 1)(n + 1)$, and then multiply both sides by 3. Using this, we can rewrite the expression as $3(2^2 - 1) = 3 \\cdot (2-1)(2+1)$, $3(4^2 - 1) = 3 \\cdot (4-1)(4+1)$, and so on. We can continue this process for all pairs of terms.

We can see that the terms are alternating between being cubed numbers and subtracting cubed numbers. To simplify this expression, we can use the sum of cubes formula, which is: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. Since the given expression is an alternating sum of cubes, we can pair the terms as follows: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + ... + (18^3 - 17^3)$.

Similarly, for the second pair, we have $4^3 - 3^3 = (4 - 3)(4^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 + 3^2) = 1(16 + 12 + 9) = 37$. We can continue this process for each pair.

We can see that the terms are alternating between being cubed numbers and subtracting cubed numbers. To simplify this expression, we can use the sum of cubes formula, which is: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. Since the given expression is an alternating sum of cubes, we can pair the terms as follows: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + ... + (18^3 - 17^3)$. Then we can simplify each pair using the sum of cubes formula.\n</step>\nStep 2: <step>\n[Core idea]: Apply the sum of cubes formula to each pair of terms to simplify the expression.\n[Full step]: Now let's apply the sum of cubes formula to each pair of terms. For the first pair, we have $2^3 - 1^3 = (2 - 1)(2^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 1^2) = 1(4 + 2 + 1) = 7$. Similarly, for the second pair, we have $4^3 - 3^3 = (4 - 3)(4^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 + 3^2) = 1(16 + 12 + 9) = 37$. We can continue this process for each pair. After applying the formula to all pairs, we have $7 + 37 + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$. We need to find the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes to telescope the series.\n[Full step]: We notice that the difference between consecutive cubes follows a pattern: $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = n^3 - (n^3 - 3n^2 + 3n - 1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$. Applying this pattern to each pair of terms in the given expression, we get $(2^3 - 1^3) = (3 \\cdot 2^2 - 3 \\cdot 2 + 1) = 9 - 6 + 1 = 4$, $(4^3 - 3^3) = (3 \\cdot 4^2 - 3 \\cdot 4 + 1) = 48 - 12 + 1 = 37$, $(6^3 - 5^3) = (3 \\cdot 6^2 - 3 \\cdot 6 + 1) = 108 - 18 + 1 = 91$, and so on. We can continue this process for all pairs of terms. Notice that we have a difference of squares in the form of $(2n-1)^2$ in the middle of the expression, so we can expand these squares to simplify the expression further. By telescoping the series, we can simplify the given expression as the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the difference of cubes formula to simplify each pair of terms and then analyze the resulting series.\n[Full step]: Now let's apply the difference of cubes formula to each pair of terms and simplify them. This will give us $2^3 - 1^3 = (2-1)((2^2)+(2\\cdot 1)+(1^2))$, $4^3 - 3^3 = (4-3)((4^2)+(4\\cdot 3)+(3^2))$, $6^3 - 5^3 = (6-5)((6^2)+(6\\cdot 5)+(5^2))$, and so on. We can write these out in a more general form. We'll have $(2n-1)((2n-1)^2+(2n-1)(n)+(n^2))$. To simplify this, we can expand the squared term and the second term, then combine like terms. After this, we can factor out the common $(2n-1)$ from each term to get a simpler expression for each pair. This will allow us to telescope the series and evaluate the sum of all the terms more easily.\n</step>\nStep 5: <step>\n[Core idea]: Apply algebraic manipulations to factor out common terms and simplify the expression further.\n[Full step]: Now let's expand and simplify the terms obtained from the difference of cubes formula. We can write the general term as $(2n-1)((2n-1)^2+(2n-1)n+n^2)$. Expanding this, we get $(2n-1)(4n^2-4n+1+2n^2-2n+n^2)$ which simplifies to $(2n-1)(7n^2-6n+1)$. Expanding the product, we get $14n^3-12n^2+2n-7n^2+6n-1$. Simplifying this expression, we get $14n^3-19n^2+8n-1$. Now we can substitute the values of $n$ from 1 to 9 into this expression to find the sum of the terms. We have $14(1)^3-19(1)^2+8(1)-1 = 2$, $14(2)^3-19(2)^2+8(2)-1= 45$, $14(3)^3-19(3)^2+8(3)-1 = 98$, $14(4)^3-19(4)^2+8(4)-1 = 471$, $14(5)^3-19(5)^2+8(5)-1 = 992$, $14(6)^3-19(6)^2+8(6)-1 = 2239$, $14(7)^3-19(7)^2+8(7)-1 = 4642$, $14(8)^3-19(8)^2+8(8)-1 = 9433$, $14(9)^3-19(9)^2+8(9)-1 = 16198$.

We need to find the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes to telescope the series.\n[Full step]: We notice that the difference between consecutive cubes follows a pattern: $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = n^3 - (n^3 - 3n^2 + 3n - 1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$. Applying this pattern to each pair of terms in the given expression, we get $(2^3 - 1^3) = (3 \\cdot 2^2 - 3 \\cdot 2 + 1) = 9 - 6 + 1 = 4$, $(4^3 - 3^3) = (3 \\cdot 4^2 - 3 \\cdot 4 + 1) = 48 - 12 + 1 = 37$, $(6^3 - 5^3) = (3 \\cdot 6^2 - 3 \\cdot 6 + 1) = 108 - 18 + 1 = 91$, and so on. We can continue this process for all pairs of terms. Notice that we have a difference of squares in the form of $(2n-1)^2$ in the middle of the expression, so we can expand these squares to simplify the expression further. By telescoping the series, we can simplify the given expression as the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Recognize the pattern as a sum of an arithmetic series, where the difference between terms increases by 3 each time.\n[Full step]: As we have simplified each pair of terms using the sum of cubes formula, we can now combine the terms and look for a pattern. The simplified terms are:\n$3 \\cdot (2^2 - 1) + 3 \\cdot (4^2 - 1) + 3 \\cdot (6^2 - 1) + \\dots + 3 \\cdot (18^2 - 1)$. We can notice that the expression inside each pair of parentheses is of the form $n^2 - 1$, and each term is multiplied by 3. Also, the values inside the parentheses are increasing by 6 each time (i.e., $(2^2 - 1), (4^2 - 1), (6^2 - 1), \\dots, (18^2 - 1)$). This is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 6. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of these terms. The formula is: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first n terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the nth term.\n</step>\nStep 5: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the difference of squares to simplify the expression and telescope the series.\n[Full step]: The simplified terms follow the pattern of $3 \\cdot (n^2 - 1)$, and we can rewrite the expression as $3(2^2 - 1) + 3(4^2 - 1) + 3(6^2 - 1) + \\dots + 3(18^2 - 1)$. We can recognize that this is similar to the difference of squares formula, where $(n^2 - 1) = (n - 1)(n + 1)$. However, in this case, we are multiplying by 3, so we can't directly apply the difference of squares formula. Instead, we can use the fact that $(n^2 - 1) = (n - 1)(n + 1)$, and then multiply both sides by 3. Using this, we can rewrite the expression as $3(2^2 - 1) = 3 \\cdot (2-1)(2+1)$, $3(4^2 - 1) = 3 \\cdot (4-1)(4+1)$, and so on. We can continue this process for all pairs of terms. After applying this pattern to all terms, we can telescope the series and simplify the expression.\n</step>\nStep 6: [Core idea]: Simplify the expression using the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes.\n[Full step]: After applying the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes, we can telescope the series by combining the terms. Each pair of terms simplifies to a difference of the form $(2n-1)^2$. The sum of these pairs is $3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + \\dots + 17^2$. Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the odd numbers from 3 to 17.\n</step>\nStep 6: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the formula for the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers to find the sum.\n[Full step]: We can use the formula for the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers, which is $n^2$. Here, we want to find the sum of the squares of the odd numbers from 3 to 17, so we need to find the sum of the squares of the first 9 odd numbers. Therefore, the sum of the squares is $9^2 = 81$.\n</step>\nStep 7: <step>\n[Core idea]: Calculate the sum of the squares of the even numbers from 2 to 18.\n[Full step]: Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the even numbers from 2 to 18. This is equal to the sum of the squares of the first 9 even numbers. The sum of the squares of the first n even numbers is given by the formula $n(n+1)(2n+1)$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the even numbers from 2 to 18 is $9(9+1)(2\\cdot 9+1) = 9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 19 = 1710$.\n</step>\nStep 8: <step>\n[Core idea]: Apply the difference of squares formula to simplify the expression and find the final answer.\n[Full step]: Now, we can use the difference of squares formula to simplify the expression. We have $2^3 - 1^3 + 4^3 - 3^3 + 6^3 - 5^3 + \\dots + 18^3 - 17^3 = (2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) +\n"

To simplify this expression, we can use the sum of cubes formula, which is: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$.

Let's try to simplify the entire sequence by applying the formula to all pairs. We can rewrite the expression as: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$. Using the sum of cubes formula, we can rewrite each pair as: $(2-1)(2^2+2\\cdot1+1^2) + (4-3)(4^2+4\\cdot3+3^2) + \\dots + (18-17)(18^2+18\\cdot17+17^2)$.

The given sequence is $2^3 - 1^3 + 4^3 - 3^3 + 6^3 - 5^3 + \\dots + 18^3 - 17^3$. We can rewrite the sequence as: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$.

This expression can be rewritten as a sum of terms, each of which is a product of two binomials. We can then use the sum of cubes formula to simplify each of these products. The formula for the sum of cubes is: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. We can apply this formula to each pair of terms in the sequence. By simplifying each pair using the formula, we can rewrite the entire sequence as a single expression: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3) = (2-1)(2^2+2\\cdot1+1^2) + (4-3)(4^2+4\\cdot3+3^2) + (6-5)(6^2+6\\cdot5+5^2) + \\dots + (18-17)(18^2+18\\cdot17+17^2)$.

Instead, we can rearrange the terms to form two sequences: the terms where the exponent is odd (2, 4, 6, ..., 18) and the terms where the exponent is even (1, 3, 5, ..., 17). Each of these sequences is an arithmetic sequence, so we can find the sum of each sequence separately using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

In this case, we have $a_1 = 2$, $a_n = 18$, and $n = 9$ (since there are 9 terms in the sequence).

However, we are given an alternating sum of cubes, so we cannot directly apply this formula. Instead, we can rearrange the terms to form two sequences: the terms where the exponent is odd (2, 4, 6, ..., 18) and the terms where the exponent is even (1, 3, 5, ..., 17). Each of these sequences is an arithmetic sequence, so we can find the sum of each sequence separately using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Then, we can subtract the sum of the even-exponent sequence from the sum of the odd-exponent sequence to get our final answer.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Divide the terms into two arithmetic sequences, one for the odd exponents and one for the even exponents, and then find the sum of each sequence separately using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n[Full step]: Let's analyze the terms: for the odd exponents: $2^3 - 1^3 + 6^3 - 3^3 + 10^3 - 7^3 + 14^3 - 11^3 + 18^3 - 15^3$, and for the even exponents: $4^3 - 2^3 + 8^3 - 4^3 + 12^3 - 6^3 + 16^3 - 8^3 + 20^3 - 10^3$. We can see that the odd-exponent sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3, and the even-exponent sequence is also an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 4. The first term of the odd-exponent sequence is 2^3 - 1^3 = 7 and the last term is 18^3 - 15^3 = 4747. The first term of the even-exponent sequence is 4^3 - 2^3 = 58 and the last term is 20^3 - 10^3 = 14980. Now, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of each sequence. The sum of the odd-exponent sequence is: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = \\frac{10}{2}(7 + 4747) = 5(4754) = 23770$. The sum of the even-exponent sequence is: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = \\frac{10}{2}(58 + 14980) = 5(15038) = 75190$. Now, we can find the sum of the entire expression by subtracting the sum of the even-exponent sequence from the sum of the odd-exponent sequence: $23770 - 75190 = -51420$.\n\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\boxed{-51420}\n</step>\n</think>\n",

To find a direct formula for the sum of this sequence, we can use the formula for the sum of a cubic arithmetic sequence: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1^2 + a_n^2 + 2a_1a_n)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term. In this case, $a_1 = 2^3 = 8$ and $a_n = 18^3 = 5832$. We also need to find the number of terms $n$. Since the sequence starts at $2^3$ and ends at $18^3$, we can find $n$ by calculating the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence $2, 4, 6, ..., 18$. The formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference. In this case, $a_1 = 2$ and $d = 2$.

After applying the formula to all pairs, we have $7 + 37 + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$. We need to find the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes to telescope the series.\n[Full step]: We notice that the difference between consecutive cubes follows a pattern: $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = n^3 - (n^3 - 3n^2 + 3n - 1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$. Applying this pattern to each pair of terms in the given expression, we get $(2^3 - 1^3) = (3 \\cdot 2^2 - 3 \\cdot 2 + 1) = 9 - 6 + 1 = 4$, $(4^3 - 3^3) = (3 \\cdot 4^2 - 3 \\cdot 4 + 1) = 48 - 12 + 1 = 37$, $(6^3 - 5^3) = (3 \\cdot 6^2 - 3 \\cdot 6 + 1) = 108 - 18 + 1 = 91$, and so on. We can continue this process for all pairs of terms. Notice that we have a difference of squares in the form of $(2n-1)^2$ in the middle of the expression, so we can expand these squares to simplify the expression further. By telescoping the series, we can simplify the given expression as the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Factor the given expression as a sum of two arithmetic series, one for the cubes and one for the alternating signs.\n[Full step]: Now, let's factor the given expression as a sum of two arithmetic series. We can rewrite the expression as $S = (2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$. We can see that this expression is a sum of two arithmetic series: one for the cubes and one for the alternating signs. For the cubes, we have the series $2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + \\dots + 18^3$. For the alternating signs, we have the series $+ - + - + \\dots -$. By pairing these two series together, we can simplify the expression further. Notice that the cubes series is an arithmetic series with a common difference of $2^3 = 8$. The number of terms is $(18-2)/2 + 1 = 9$. The sum of the cubes series is given by the formula $S_{cubes} = 9/2 \\cdot (2^3 + 18^3) = 9/2 \\cdot (8 + 5832) = 9/2 \\cdot 5840 = 26220$. For the alternating signs series, we have $9$ terms, and the first term is $-1$ and the last term is $-1$. So the sum of the alternating signs series is $-1$. By adding the sums of the two series together, we get $S = 26220 - 1 = 26219$.\n\nThe final answer to the question is \\boxed{26219}\n</think>\n",

For the first pair, we have $2^3 - 1^3 = (2 - 1)(2^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 1^2) = 1(4 + 2 + 1) = 7$. Similarly, for the second pair, we have $4^3 - 3^3 = (4 - 3)(4^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 + 3^2) = 1(16 + 12 + 9) = 37$. We can continue this process for each pair. After applying the formula to all pairs, we have $7 + 37 + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$. We need to find the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes to telescope the series.\n[Full step]: We notice that the difference between consecutive cubes follows a pattern: $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = n^3 - (n^3 - 3n^2 + 3n - 1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$. Applying this pattern to each pair of terms in the given expression, we get $(2^3 - 1^3) = (3 \\cdot 2^2 - 3 \\cdot 2 + 1) = 9 - 6 + 1 = 4$, $(4^3 - 3^3) = (3 \\cdot 4^2 - 3 \\cdot 4 + 1) = 48 - 12 + 1 = 37$, $(6^3 - 5^3) = (3 \\cdot 6^2 - 3 \\cdot 6 + 1) = 108 - 18 + 1 = 91$, and so on. We can continue this process for all pairs of terms. Notice that we have a difference of squares in the form of $(2n-1)^2$ in the middle of the expression, so we can expand these squares to simplify the expression further. By telescoping the series, we can simplify the given expression as the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Recognize the pattern as a sum of an arithmetic series, where the difference between terms increases by 3 each time.\n[Full step]: As we have simplified each pair of terms using the sum of cubes formula, we can now combine the terms and look for a pattern. The simplified terms are:\n$3 \\cdot (2^2 - 1) + 3 \\cdot (4^2 - 1) + 3 \\cdot (6^2 - 1) + \\dots + 3 \\cdot (18^2 - 1)$. We can notice that the expression inside each pair of parentheses is of the form $n^2 - 1$, and each term is multiplied by 3. Also, the values inside the parentheses are increasing by 6 each time (i.e., $(2^2 - 1), (4^2 - 1), (6^2 - 1), \\dots, (18^2 - 1)$). This is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 6. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of these terms. The formula is: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first n terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the nth term.\n</step>\nStep 5: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the difference of squares to simplify the expression and telescope the series.\n[Full step]: The simplified terms follow the pattern of $3 \\cdot (n^2 - 1)$, and we can rewrite the expression as $3(2^2 - 1) + 3(4^2 - 1) + 3(6^2 - 1) + \\dots + 3(18^2 - 1)$. We can recognize that this is similar to the difference of squares formula, where $(n^2 - 1) = (n - 1)(n + 1)$. However, in this case, we are multiplying by 3, so we can't directly apply the difference of squares formula. Instead, we can use the fact that $(n^2 - 1) = (n - 1)(n + 1)$, and then multiply both sides by 3. Using this, we can rewrite the expression as $3(2^2 - 1) = 3 \\cdot (2-1)(2+1)$, $3(4^2 - 1) = 3 \\cdot (4-1)(4+1)$, and so on. We can continue this process for all pairs of terms. After applying this pattern to all terms, we can telescope the series and simplify the expression.\n</step>\n[Core idea]: Simplify the expression by telescoping the series\n[Full step]: We can simplify the expression by telescoping the series. By applying the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes and using the difference of squares formula, we can rewrite the expression as $3(2^2 - 1) + 3(4^2 - 1) + 3(6^2 - 1) + \\dots + 3(18^2 - 1)$. We can further simplify this expression by factoring the differences as $3(2-1)(2+1) + 3(4-1)(4+1) + 3(6-1)(6+1) + \\dots + 3(18-1)(18+1)$. Now, we can telescope the series by canceling out the terms. We have $3(1)(3) + 3(3)(5) + 3(5)(7) + \\dots + 3(17)(19)$.\n</step>\n<step>\n[Core idea]: Simplify the expression by factoring out the common term\n[Full step]: We can simplify the expression by factoring out the common term 3. By factoring out 3, we get $3(1 \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot 5 + 5 \\cdot 7 + \\dots + 17 \\cdot 19)$. Now, we can simplify the expression inside the parentheses.\n</step>\n<step>\n[Core idea]: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses\n[Full step]: We can simplify the expression inside the parentheses by noticing that each term is the product of two consecutive numbers. We can rewrite the expression as $3(1 \\cdot (3+5) + 3 \\cdot (5+7) + 3 \\cdot (7+9) + \\dots + 3 \\cdot (17+19))$. Simplifying further, we get $3(8 + 12 + 16 + \\dots + 36)$.\n</step>\n<step>\n[Core idea]: Simplify the expression using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series\n[Full step]: We can simplify the expression using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The expression inside the parentheses is an arithmetic series with first term $a_1 = 8$, last term $a_n = 36$, and common difference $d = 4$. The number of terms is $n = (36 - 8) / 4 + 1 = 9$. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$. Plugging in the values, we get $S_9 = \\frac{9}{2}(8 + 36) = 4.5 \\cdot 44 = 198$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to $3(198)$.\n</step>\nStep 6: <step>\n[Core idea]: Multiply the simplified expression by 3\n[Full step]: We can simplify the expression by multiplying the result by 3.

We can see that the terms are alternating between being cubed numbers and subtracting cubed numbers. To simplify this expression, we can use the sum of cubes formula, which is: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. Since the given expression is an alternating sum of cubes, we can pair the terms as follows: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + ... + (18^3 - 17^3)$.

After applying the formula to all pairs, we have $7 + 37 + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$. We need to find the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes to telescope the series.\n[Full step]: We notice that the difference between consecutive cubes follows a pattern: $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = n^3 - (n^3 - 3n^2 + 3n - 1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$. Applying this pattern to each pair of terms in the given expression, we get $(2^3 - 1^3) = (3 \\cdot 2^2 - 3 \\cdot 2 + 1) = 9 - 6 + 1 = 4$, $(4^3 - 3^3) = (3 \\cdot 4^2 - 3 \\cdot 4 + 1) = 48 - 12 + 1 = 37$, $(6^3 - 5^3) = (3 \\cdot 6^2 - 3 \\cdot 6 + 1) = 108 - 18 + 1 = 91$, and so on. We can continue this process for all pairs of terms. Notice that we have a difference of squares in the form of $(2n-1)^2$ in the middle of the expression, so we can expand these squares to simplify the expression further. By telescoping the series, we can simplify the given expression as the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Recognize the pattern as a sum of an arithmetic series, where the difference between terms increases by 3 each time.\n[Full step]: As we have simplified each pair of terms using the sum of cubes formula, we can now combine the terms and look for a pattern. The simplified terms are:\n$3 \\cdot (2^2 - 1) + 3 \\cdot (4^2 - 1) + 3 \\cdot (6^2 - 1) + \\dots + 3 \\cdot (18^2 - 1)$. We can notice that the expression inside each pair of parentheses is of the form $n^2 - 1$, and each term is multiplied by 3. Also, the values inside the parentheses are increasing by 6 each time (i.e., $(2^2 - 1), (4^2 - 1), (6^2 - 1), \\dots, (18^2 - 1)$). This is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 6. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of these terms. The formula is: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first n terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the nth term.\n</step>\nStep 5: <step>\n[Core idea]: Apply the arithmetic series formula to find the sum of the expression.\n[Full step]:  The pattern we observed is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 3. The first term is $3 \\cdot (2^2 - 1) = 11$ and the last term is $3 \\cdot (18^2 - 1) = 527$. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$. To find the number of terms, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$. In this case, $a_n = 527$, $a_1 = 11$, and $d = 3$. We can solve for n: $527 = 11 + (n-1)3 \\Rightarrow 516 = 3n - 3 \\Rightarrow 519 = 3n \\Rightarrow n = 173$. Now we have all the values we need to find the sum of the series: $S_n = \\frac{173}{2}(11 + 527) = 173 \\cdot 269 = 46577$. However, we need to remember that the terms in the original series are in the form of $(2n-1)^2$ and are multiplied by $3$. This is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 6. So, let's calculate the sum of the differences between the terms in the original series. We can do this by calculating the sum of the squares of the first and last terms and then subtracting the sum of the squares of the other terms. The sum of the squares of the first and last terms is $(2^2-1)^2+(2\\cdot6-1)^2+\\dots+(2\\cdot18-1)^2+(2\\cdot18+1)^2$. The sum of the squares of the other terms is $(2^2)^2+(2\\cdot2-1)^2+(2\\cdot4-1)^2+\\dots+(2\\cdot16-1)^2+(2\\cdot18-1)^2$. We can find the sum of the squares of the first and last terms by applying the formula for the sum of squares of an arithmetic sequence: $S_n = \\frac{n}{6}(2a^2 + (n-1)d^2)$. In this case, $a = 1$, $\n</step>\nThe pattern we observed is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 3. The first term is $3 \\cdot (2^2 - 1) = 11$ and the last term is $3 \\cdot (18^2 - 1) = 527$. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.

We can solve for n: $527 = 11 + (n-1)3 \\Rightarrow 516 = 3n - 3 \\Rightarrow 519 = 3n \\Rightarrow n = 173$. However, this n is for the difference of cubes formula, not the original series. We can calculate the sum of the differences between the terms in the original series as $3\\cdot\\frac{173}{2}\\cdot(11+527)$, but the correct approach is to sum the first 9 terms of the arithmetic series directly: $3(2^2 - 1) + 3(4^2 - 1) + 3(6^2 - 1) + 3(8^2 - 1) + 3(10^2 - 1) + 3(12^2 - 1) + 3(14^2 - 1) + 3(16^2 - 1) + 3(18^2 - 1)$. This can be simplified as $3(4+16+36+64+100+144+196+256+324)$, and this is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 48. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$ to find the sum.\n</step>\n\n<step>\nTo find the sum of the arithmetic series $3(4+16+36+64+100+144+196+256+324)$, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$. In this case, $a_1 = 4$, $a_n = 324$, and $n = 9$. However, this is not correct as we have a sum of squares. We can find the sum of squares by using the formula for the sum of squares of an arithmetic series: $S_n = \\frac{n}{6}(2a^2 + (n-1)d^2)$. In this case, $a = 4$, $d = 48$, and $n = 9$. We can plug these values into the formula to find the sum of the squares: $S_n = \\frac{9}{6}(2 \\cdot 4^2 + (9-1) \\cdot 48^2) = \\frac{9}{6}(32 + 8 \\cdot 2304) = \\frac{9}{6}(32 + 18432) = \\frac{9}{6}(18464) = 3 \\cdot 3074.67 = 9223.01$. Finally, we multiply this sum by 3 to get the sum of the differences between the terms in the original series: $3 \\cdot 9223.01 = 27669.03$. The difference between the sum of the terms and the sum of the differences is $2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 + 10^3 + 12^3 + 14^3 + 16^3 + 18^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 + 1000 + 1728 + 2744 + 4096 + 5832 = 18140$. The difference between the sum of the differences and the sum of the terms is 27669.03 - 18140 = 9529.03. However, we need to remember that the terms in the original series are in the form of $(2n-1)^2$ and are multiplied by $3$. This is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 6. So, let's calculate the sum of the differences between the terms in the original series as the sum of the squares of the first and last terms and then subtract the sum of the squares of the other terms.\n</step>\n\n<step>\nTo find the sum of the squares of the first and last terms, we can use the formula for",

We can see that the terms are alternating between being cubed numbers and subtracting cubed numbers. To simplify this expression, we can use the sum of cubes formula, which is: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$.

We can see that the terms are alternating between being cubed numbers and subtracting cubed numbers. To simplify this expression, we can use the sum of cubes formula, which is: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. Since the given expression is an alternating sum of cubes, we can pair the terms as follows: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + ... + (18^3 - 17^3)$. Then we can simplify each pair using the sum of cubes formula.\n</step>\nStep 2: <step>\n[Core idea]: Apply the sum of cubes formula to each pair of terms to simplify the expression.\n[Full step]: Now let's apply the sum of cubes formula to each pair of terms. For the first pair, we have $2^3 - 1^3 = (2 - 1)(2^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 1^2) = 1(4 + 2 + 1) = 7$. Similarly, for the second pair, we have $4^3 - 3^3 = (4 - 3)(4^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 + 3^2) = 1(16 + 12 + 9) = 37$. We can continue this process for each pair. After applying the formula to all pairs, we have $7 + 37 + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$. We need to find the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Apply the sum of cubes formula to the entire sequence to simplify it as a single expression.\n[Full step]: Now we can see that the expression consists of pairs of terms, each of which can be simplified using the sum of cubes formula. Let's try to simplify the entire sequence by applying the formula to all pairs. We can rewrite the expression as: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$. Using the sum of cubes formula, we can rewrite each pair as: $(2-1)(2^2+2\\cdot1+1^2) + (4-3)(4^2+4\\cdot3+3^2) + \\dots + (18-17)(18^2+18\\cdot17+17^2)$. This simplifies to: $7 + 37 + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$, which is a sum of consecutive terms. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to simplify it further.\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Recognize the alternating pattern as a telescoping series to simplify the expression.\n[Full step]: Looking at the simplified expression $7 + 37 + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$, we can see that each term is the difference of two consecutive cubes. Now, let's recognize that this is an example of a telescoping series. In a telescoping series, each term in the series cancels out part of the next term, leaving only the first and last terms. In this case, we can notice that the first term in each pair cancels out the second term in the previous pair. For example, the first term $7$ cancels out the $-7$ in the sum $(4^3 - 2^3) + (6^3 - 4^3) + (8^3 - 6^3) + (10^3 - 8^3) + \\dots + (18^3 - 16^3)$. This means that we are left with only the first term and the last term, which are $7$ and $(18^3 - 17^3)$ respectively. Therefore, the simplified expression is $7 + (18^3 - 17^3)$.\n</step>\nStep 5: <step>\n[Core idea]: Recognize the pattern as a sum of consecutive terms and use arithmetic series formulas.\n[Full step]: Now, let's recognize that the simplified expression $7 + 37 + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$ is a sum of consecutive terms. We can see that each term is increasing by a constant difference of $30$. To simplify this expression, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term. In this case, we have $a_1 = 7$ and $a_n = 18^3 - 17^3$. The number of terms is equal to the difference between the last and first term in the sequence, which is $18 - 2 = 16$. We can plug these values into the formula to get the sum of the series.\n</step>\n[Core idea]: Calculate the sum using the arithmetic series formula.\n[Full step]: We can now plug the values into the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$. Plugging in $n=16$, $a_1=7$, and $a_n=18^3-17^3$, we get: $S_n = \\frac{16}{2}(7 + 18^3 - 17^3) = 8(7 + 18^3 - 17^3)$.\n</step>\n<step>\n[Core idea]: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses.\n[Full step]: To find the value of the expression $18^3 - 17^3$, we can use the formula for the difference of cubes: $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. In this case, $a = 18$ and $b = 17$, so the expression becomes $(18-17)(18^2 + 18\\cdot17 + 17^2)$. This simplifies to: $(1)(324 + 306 + 289) = 919$. Now we can plug this value into the previous expression: $8(7 + 919)$.\n</step>\n<step>\n[Core idea]: Calculate the sum.\n[Full step]: Now we can simplify the expression $8(7 + 919)$ by evaluating the sum inside the parentheses: $8(926) = 7428$.\n</step>\n<step>\n[Core idea]: Final answer.\n[Full step]: Therefore, the sum of the given expression is $\\boxed{7428}",

Specifically, the differences between consecutive terms are 30, 106, 340, and so on. This pattern can help us simplify the series further. Let's write the series in terms of its differences:\n$7 + 7 + 30 + 7 + 30 + 106 + 7 + 30 + 106 + 340 + 7 + 30 + 106 + 340 + 1080 + 7 + 30 + 106 + 340 + 1080 + 3230 + 7 + 30 + 106 + 340 + 1080 + 3230 + 9580$.\nThis series can be simplified as the sum of the first term and the sum of the differences between consecutive terms.\n</step>\n<step>\n[Core idea]: Simplify the series by summing the first term and the differences between consecutive terms.\n[Full step]: Now, let's simplify the series:\n$7 + 7 + 30 + 7 + 30 + 106 + 7 + 30 + 106 + 340 + 7 + 30 + 106 + 340 + 1080 + 7 + 30 + 106 + 340 + 1080 + 3230 + 7 + 30 + 106 + 340 + 1080 + 3230 + 9580$.\nThe first term is 7. The differences between consecutive terms are 30, 106, 340, 1080, 3230, and 9580. Let's simplify the series by summing the first term and the differences between consecutive terms.\nThe sum of the first term is $7$.\nThe sum of the differences between consecutive terms is $30 + 106 + 340 + 1080 + 3230 + 9580$.\nThis can be simplified as:\n$30 + 106 + 340 + 1080 + 3230 + 9580 = 30(1 + 3.53 + 11.33 + 36 + 107.67 + 319.33)$.\nThe sum of the terms in the parentheses is a geometric series with a common ratio of 3.53, 11.33, 36, 107.67, and 319.33.

We can see that the terms are alternating between being cubed numbers and subtracting cubed numbers. To simplify this expression, we can use the sum of cubes formula, which is: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. Since the given expression is an alternating sum of cubes, we can pair the terms as follows: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + ... + (18^3 - 17^3)$. Then we can simplify each pair using the sum of cubes formula.\n</step>\nStep 2: <step>\n[Core idea]: Apply the sum of cubes formula to each pair of terms to simplify the expression.\n[Full step]: Now let's apply the sum of cubes formula to each pair of terms. For the first pair, we have $2^3 - 1^3 = (2 - 1)(2^2 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 1^2) = 1(4 + 2 + 1) = 7$. Similarly, for the second pair, we have $4^3 - 3^3 = (4 - 3)(4^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 + 3^2) = 1(16 + 12 + 9) = 37$. We can continue this process for each pair. After applying the formula to all pairs, we have $7 + 37 + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$. We need to find the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 3: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes to telescope the series.\n[Full step]: We notice that the difference between consecutive cubes follows a pattern: $n^3 - (n-1)^3 = n^3 - (n^3 - 3n^2 + 3n - 1) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1$. Applying this pattern to each pair of terms in the given expression, we get $(2^3 - 1^3) = (3 \\cdot 2^2 - 3 \\cdot 2 + 1) = 9 - 6 + 1 = 4$, $(4^3 - 3^3) = (3 \\cdot 4^2 - 3 \\cdot 4 + 1) = 48 - 12 + 1 = 37$, $(6^3 - 5^3) = (3 \\cdot 6^2 - 3 \\cdot 6 + 1) = 108 - 18 + 1 = 91$, and so on. We can continue this process for all pairs of terms. Notice that we have a difference of squares in the form of $(2n-1)^2$ in the middle of the expression, so we can expand these squares to simplify the expression further. By telescoping the series, we can simplify the given expression as the sum of these simplified terms.\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Recognize the pattern as a sum of an arithmetic series, where the difference between terms increases by 3 each time.\n[Full step]: As we have simplified each pair of terms using the sum of cubes formula, we can now combine the terms and look for a pattern. The simplified terms are:\n$3 \\cdot (2^2 - 1) + 3 \\cdot (4^2 - 1) + 3 \\cdot (6^2 - 1) + \\dots + 3 \\cdot (18^2 - 1)$. We can notice that the expression inside each pair of parentheses is of the form $n^2 - 1$, and each term is multiplied by 3. Also, the values inside the parentheses are increasing by 6 each time (i.e., $(2^2 - 1), (4^2 - 1), (6^2 - 1), \\dots, (18^2 - 1)$). This is an arithmetic series with a common difference of 6. We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of these terms. The formula is: $S_n = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first n terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the nth term.\n</step>\nStep 5: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the difference of squares to simplify the expression and telescope the series.\n[Full step]: The simplified terms follow the pattern of $3 \\cdot (n^2 - 1)$, and we can rewrite the expression as $3(2^2 - 1) + 3(4^2 - 1) + 3(6^2 - 1) + \\dots + 3(18^2 - 1)$. We can recognize that this is similar to the difference of squares formula, where $(n^2 - 1) = (n - 1)(n + 1)$. However, in this case, we are multiplying by 3, so we can't directly apply the difference of squares formula. Instead, we can use the fact that $(n^2 - 1) = (n - 1)(n + 1)$, and then multiply both sides by 3. Using this, we can rewrite the expression as $3(2^2 - 1) = 3 \\cdot (2-1)(2+1)$, $3(4^2 - 1) = 3 \\cdot (4-1)(4+1)$, and so on. We can continue this process for all pairs of terms. After applying this pattern to all terms, we can telescope the series and simplify the expression.\n</step>\nStep 6: [Core idea]: Simplify the expression using the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes.\n[Full step]: After applying the pattern of differences between consecutive cubes, we can telescope the series by combining the terms. Each pair of terms simplifies to a difference of the form $(2n-1)^2$. The sum of these pairs is $3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + \\dots + 17^2$. Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the odd numbers from 3 to 17.\n</step>\nStep 6: <step>\n[Core idea]: Use the formula for the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers to find the sum.\n[Full step]: We can use the formula for the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers, which is $n^2$. Here, we want to find the sum of the squares of the odd numbers from 3 to 17, so we need to find the sum of the squares of the first 9 odd numbers. Therefore, the sum of the squares is $9^2 = 81$.\n</step>\nStep 7: <step>\n[Core idea]: Calculate the sum of the squares of the even numbers from 2 to 18.\n[Full step]: Now, we need to find the sum of the squares of the even numbers from 2 to 18. This is equal to the sum of the squares of the first 9 even numbers. The sum of the squares of the first n even numbers is given by the formula $n(n+1)(2n+1)$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the even numbers from 2 to 18 is $9(9+1)(2\\cdot 9+1) = 9 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 19 = 1710$.\n</step>\nStep 8: <step>\n[Core idea]: Apply the difference of squares formula to simplify the expression and find the final answer.\n[Full step]: Now, we can use the difference of squares formula to simplify the expression. We have $2^3 - 1^3 + 4^3 - 3^3 + 6^3 - 5^3 + \\dots + 18^3 - 17^3 = (2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) +\n",

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to simplify it further.\n</step>\nStep 4: <step>\n[Core idea]: Apply the sum of cubes formula for the entire sequence using a direct approach.\n[Full step]:  We can apply the sum of cubes formula directly to the entire sequence by considering the common difference between consecutive terms. The given sequence is $2^3 - 1^3 + 4^3 - 3^3 + 6^3 - 5^3 + \\dots + 18^3 - 17^3$. We can rewrite the sequence as: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3)$. Now we can factor out a common difference of 1 between each pair of terms: $(2-1)(2^2+2\\cdot1+1^2) + (4-3)(4^2+4\\cdot3+3^2) + (6-5)(6^2+6\\cdot5+5^2) + \\dots + (18-17)(18^2+18\\cdot17+17^2)$. This expression can be rewritten as a sum of terms, each of which is a product of two binomials. We can then use the sum of cubes formula to simplify each of these products. The formula for the sum of cubes is: $a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)$. We can apply this formula to each pair of terms in the sequence. By simplifying each pair using the formula, we can rewrite the entire sequence as a single expression: $(2^3 - 1^3) + (4^3 - 3^3) + (6^3 - 5^3) + \\dots + (18^3 - 17^3) = (2-1)(2^2+2\\cdot1+1^2) + (4-3)(4^2+4\\cdot3+3^2) + (6-5)(6^2+6\\cdot5+5^2) + \\dots + (18-17)(18^2+18\\cdot17+17^2)$.
