  推理路径:
    1. <step>
[Core idea]: Convert the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$
[Full step]: To convert the point $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates, we need to find the distance from the origin to the point $(0, 3)$ and the angle between the positive $x$-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point. The distance $r$ can be found using the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. Since $x = 0$, we have $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3$. The angle $\theta$ can be found using the formula $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}$. However, since $x = 0$, the angle is either $\frac{\pi}{2}$ or $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ depending on the sign of $y$. In this case, since $y = 3 > 0$, we have $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$.
</step>
    2. <step>
[Core idea]: Approach the problem graphically by examining the position of the point (0,3) in the polar coordinate system to determine the angle.
[Full step]: When graphing the point (0,3) in the polar coordinate system, we observe that it lies on the positive y-axis. This means the angle between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point is a right angle, i.e., 90 degrees. However, since the angle is measured in radians, we convert 90 degrees to radians which is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians. Therefore, the polar coordinates of the point (0,3) are $(r, \theta) = (3, \frac{\pi}{2})$.


The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}
