[Core idea]: To determine the student with the greatest average speed, we need to calculate the total distance each student ran and the total time it took for each student to complete the run, then divide the distance by time for each student to get the average speed.
[Full step]:  The total distance each student ran can be determined by the horizontal distance from the y-axis. The distance for Evelyn, Briana, Carla, Debra, and Angela are 2, 2.5, 4, 5.6, and 6.8 respectively. The total time each student took can be determined by the vertical distance from the x-axis. The time for Evelyn, Briana, Carla, Debra, and Angela are 4.5, 2.2, 5.2, 2.8, and 1.4 respectively. To find the average speed of each student, we need to divide the total distance by the total time for each student. To calculate the average speed for Evelyn: average speed = 2 / 4.5 = 0.444, for Briana: average speed = 2.5 / 2.2 = 1.136, for Carla: average speed = 4 / 5.2 = 0.769, for Debra: average speed = 5.6 / 2.8 = 2, for Angela: average speed = 6.8 / 1.4 = 4.857.

[Core idea]: Recognize that the student with the smallest ratio of time to distance will have the greatest average speed.

------------------------------expand_response------------------------------
 Given the average speeds calculated for each student in the previous step: Evelyn (0.444), Briana (1.136), Carla (0.769), Debra (2), and Angela (4.857), the student with the greatest average speed is the one with the highest value among these calculated average speeds. We can see that Angela's average speed is the highest.
</step>

[Check terminal] The final answer to the question is \boxed{Angela}.
------------------------------error------------------------------
Error processing case 5: unterminated character set at position 10
------------------------------expand_response------------------------------
  To compare the students' average speeds, we need to look for the student who has the highest x-coordinate on the graph, as this indicates the longest distance, and the lowest y-coordinate, as this indicates the least time. The students' positions on the graph are (1.25, 4.5), (2.5, 2.2), (4.25, 5.2), (5.6, 2.8), and (6.8, 1.4). The student with the highest x-coordinate is Angela, which indicates she ran the farthest distance. The student with the lowest y-coordinate is Angela, indicating she ran the least amount of time. Therefore, Angela has the greatest average speed.

</step>

[Check terminal]
The final answer to the question is \boxed{Angela}.
------------------------------expand_response------------------------------
  The ratio of time to distance is a measure of speed. In this case, the student with the smallest ratio of time to distance will be the fastest, since a smaller ratio indicates a faster average speed. We can determine the ratio of time to distance for each student by dividing the time it took them to complete the run by the distance they ran. The student with the smallest ratio will have the greatest average speed. Based on the data, we can calculate the ratio for each student: 4.5/2 = 2.25, 2.2/2.5 = 0.88, 5.2/4 = 1.3, 2.8/5.6 = 0.5, 1.4/6.8 = 0.206. According to the ratios, Debra has the smallest ratio and the greatest average speed.
</step>

[Check terminal]
The final answer to the question is \boxed{Debra}.
