<step>
[Core idea]: Find the length of one side of the equilateral triangle and use it to find the total perimeter of the regular hexagon.
[Full step]: The perimeter of one equilateral triangle is 21 inches. Since an equilateral triangle has three equal sides, we can divide the perimeter by 3 to find the length of one side. 21 / 3 = 7 inches. Since a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, the total perimeter of the hexagon will be six times the length of one side of the equilateral triangle, which is 6 x 7 = 42 inches.

 Since the area of the equilateral triangle is not given, we cannot calculate the side length of the hexagon directly. However, we can use the fact that the area of an equilateral triangle is (sqrt(3) / 4) * s^2, where s is the side length. Since we are not given the area of the equilateral triangle, we cannot proceed further with this step. We will have to go back to the previous step and explore other options.

 Since the regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, the length of one side of the hexagon will be equal to the length of one side of the equilateral triangle, which we found to be 7 inches. The perimeter of a hexagon is the sum of the lengths of its sides. Since all sides of a regular hexagon are equal, the perimeter will be 6 times the length of one side, which is 6 x 7 = 42 inches.

The final answer to the question is \boxed{42}.

 Since one equilateral triangle has a perimeter of 21 inches and the perimeter of the hexagon is made up of 6 equilateral triangles, we can find the total perimeter of the hexagon by multiplying the perimeter of one equilateral triangle by 6 and then dividing that result by 3 (since each side of the hexagon is equal to two sides of the equilateral triangle). However, this is mathematically equivalent to multiplying the perimeter of one equilateral triangle by 2 (6 / 3 = 2). So the perimeter of the hexagon is 21 * 2 = 42 inches.

[Check terminal]
The final answer to the question is \boxed{42}.
