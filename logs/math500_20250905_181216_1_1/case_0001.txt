[Core idea]: Convert the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$
[Full step]: To convert the point $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates, we need to find the distance $r$ from the origin to the point and the angle $\theta$ that the line connecting the origin and the point makes with the positive x-axis. The distance $r$ can be found using the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},$ and the angle $\theta$ can be found using the formula $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$ Since the given point is $(0, 3),$ we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3.$ Substituting these values into the formulas, we get $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3,$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)}.$ However, since the point lies on the positive y-axis, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ because it forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis.

 Since we have a problem with the arctan function at x = 0 (division by zero), we need to consider the case when x = 0, and y > 0, which corresponds to the point being on the positive y-axis. In this case, the angle θ will be π/2 because the point forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis. This is a special case that needs to be handled separately.

 We observe that the point $(0,3)$ lies on the positive y-axis.

 The step acknowledges the issue with the arctan function when x=0 and provides a correct consideration for the special case where the point lies on the positive y-axis. It also correctly identifies the angle θ as π/2. However, the step is more of a justification of the given answer rather than a step-by-step reasoning that leads to the solution. It also assumes that the reader is already aware of the arctan issue and the correct polar coordinate representation. The step does not follow the format of a typical step in a solution process, which usually involves an initial problem statement, a thought process, and a conclusion. Furthermore, it seems to be more of a concluding statement rather than a step in the solution process. Therefore, it does not fully meet the objectives of a typical step in a solution.

 The given solution is mostly correct, but it does not fully address the calculation of the radial distance $r$. The step only mentions using the arctan function, but then later states that it is not needed, implying a slight inconsistency. The solution does correctly determine the angle $\theta$ as $\frac{\pi}{2}$, but it does not explicitly calculate the value of $r$ using the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.

The equation of the unit circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 1.$ Since the point is on the y-axis, we can substitute $x=0$ into the equation, resulting in $0^2 + y^2 = 1,$ which simplifies to $y^2 = 1.$ This implies that $y = \pm 1.$ However, since the point is at $y = 3,$ we can conclude that the point is actually at a distance of 3 from the origin in the positive y-direction, which means the polar coordinate is $(3, \frac{\pi}{2}).$ This is because the angle with the positive x-axis is 90 degrees, or $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians.


The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}

 The step is attempting to leverage the relationship between the point and the unit circle to find the polar coordinates. However, it contains an error. The equation of the unit circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, but this equation is used to find the points on the unit circle, not to determine the distance of the given point from the origin. Since the point $(0,3)$ is given, we can directly use the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ to find the distance, which is $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = 3$. The step also incorrectly concludes that $y = \pm 1$ from the equation $y^2 = 1$, which is a correct step but not relevant to the problem. Furthermore, the step correctly identifies that the angle is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ because the point lies on the positive y-axis.

Question: Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Convert the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$
[Full step]: To convert the point $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates, we need to find the distance $r$ from the origin to the point and the angle $\theta$ that the line connecting the origin and the point makes with the positive x-axis. The distance $r$ can be found using the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},$ and the angle $\theta$ can be found using the formula $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$ Since the given point is $(0, 3),$ we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3.$ Substituting these values into the formulas, we get $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3,$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)}.$ However, since the point lies on the positive y-axis, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ because it forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Address the issue of the arctan calculation with the point (0,3) to determine a suitable angle, considering the cases where the denominator is zero.
[Full step]: Since we have a problem with the arctan function at x = 0 (division by zero), we need to consider the case when x = 0, and y > 0, which corresponds to the point being on the positive y-axis. In this case, the angle θ will be π/2 because the point forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis. This is a special case that needs to be handled separately. The correct polar coordinates are (r, θ) = (3, π/2).

 The solution is generally correct and follows a logical approach to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. However, there seems to be a minor issue with the evaluation of the arctan function when x = 0. The solution correctly identifies that this is a special case and handles it separately, resulting in the correct angle of π/2. The solution also correctly calculates the value of r as 3. The only potential issue is that the solution could have been presented in a more concise format, but this does not affect the correctness of the answer.

 The solution is clear and concise, providing a step-by-step explanation for converting the point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It correctly identifies the formulas for r and θ, and applies them to the given point (0,3). The solution also acknowledges the special case for points on the positive y-axis, which is a valid approach. However, the final answer is not presented in a boxed format as requested, which is a minor formatting issue.

The only potential issue with the solution is that it does not explicitly state that the point (0,3) lies on the positive y-axis, which might not be immediately clear to someone reading the solution. However, this is a minor point, and the solution is generally well-written.

 The solution is mostly correct, but it could be improved. The explanation is clear and concise, and it follows the correct formulas for converting rectangular to polar coordinates. However, the explanation in step 2 seems unnecessary and might confuse the reader, as it introduces an equation of the unit circle and discusses the relationship between the point and the unit circle without directly contributing to the solution. Also, the solution could benefit from more attention to formatting and presentation. The step-by-step format is clear, but the text is not properly aligned, and some sentences are missing the step label.

Overall, the solution is well-intentioned and follows the correct process, but it could be improved with better organization, clearer formatting, and more careful consideration of the problem's requirements.

Comparing the two steps, we see that they both aim to address the issue of finding the polar coordinates of the point (0,3). However, Step A and Step B have some differences in their approaches. Step A starts by addressing the issue of the arctan calculation at x = 0 (division by zero), while Step B directly recalls that points on the positive y-axis have an angle of π/2. In terms of meeting the process criterion of "Is there any obvious error?", both steps do not have any obvious errors. However, Step A provides more information about the arctan function and its limitations, which is a good practice in problem-solving. On the other hand, Step B is more concise and directly addresses the specific case of the point (0,3) on the positive y-axis. In terms of meeting the process criterion of "Does it help solve the question?", both steps help solve the question, as they both arrive at the correct polar coordinates (3, π/2). However, Step B is more efficient and directly addresses the specific case, which is a better approach in this situation.

 Both steps address the issue of handling the arctan calculation when x = 0, but they differ in their approach. Step A provides a more straightforward explanation of the special case when x = 0 and y > 0, concluding that the angle θ will be π/2. Step B, on the other hand, takes a more geometric approach, exploring the relationship between the point and the unit circle to infer the correct polar coordinates. However, it contains a mistake in the equation $0^2 + y^2 = 1$ as the correct equation should be $r^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 3^2 = 9$, not $1$. This error hinders the effectiveness of Step B in providing a clear and accurate solution.

The equation of the unit circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 1.$ Since the point is on the y-axis, we can substitute $x=0$ into the equation, resulting in $0^2 + y^2 = 1,$ which simplifies to $y^2 = 1.$ This implies that $y = \pm 1.$ However, since the point is at $y = 3,$ we can conclude that the point is actually at a distance of 3 from the origin in the positive y-direction, which means the polar coordinate is $(3, \frac{\pi}{2}).$ This is because the angle with the positive x-axis is 90 degrees, or $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians.


The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}

Step A directly assigns an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to the point $(0,3)$ based on its position on the positive y-axis, without using the arctan function. This is a more straightforward and efficient approach, especially for points on the axes. In contrast, Step B uses the equation of the unit circle, which is not necessary in this case, and incorrectly simplifies the equation to $y^2 = 1$, which leads to a incorrect conclusion. Moreover, Step B fails to recognize the special case of the point being on the positive y-axis and instead tries to apply the unit circle equation, which is not applicable here. Therefore, Step A is more accurate and efficient in solving the problem.

Question: Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Convert the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$
[Full step]: To convert the point $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates, we need to find the distance $r$ from the origin to the point and the angle $\theta$ that the line connecting the origin and the point makes with the positive x-axis. The distance $r$ can be found using the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},$ and the angle $\theta$ can be found using the formula $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$ Since the given point is $(0, 3),$ we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3.$ Substituting these values into the formulas, we get $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3,$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)}.$ However, since the point lies on the positive y-axis, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ because it forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Recall that for points on the positive y-axis, the angle can be directly assigned a value based on the quadrant and the position of the point, without using the arctan function.
[Full step]: Since the point $(0,3)$ lies on the positive y-axis, we can directly assign an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to it, as it forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis. This is a special case where the arctan function is not needed because we can determine the angle based on the coordinate values and the position of the point in the coordinate plane.

The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3,\frac{\pi}{2})}

</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Address the issue of the arctan calculation with the point (0,3) to determine a suitable angle, considering the cases where the denominator is zero.
[Full step]: Since we have a problem with the arctan function at x = 0 (division by zero), we need to consider the case when x = 0, and y > 0, which corresponds to the point being on the positive y-axis. In this case, the angle θ will be π/2 because the point forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis. This is a special case that needs to be handled separately. The correct polar coordinates are (r, θ) = (3, π/2).

 The solution effectively addresses the problem of converting a point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It correctly identifies the formulas for conversion and applies them to the given point (0, 3). The solution also correctly handles the special case where x = 0, acknowledging the issue with the arctan function and choosing the appropriate angle θ based on the location of the point on the positive y-axis. The final answer is presented in the correct format. However, the solution could be improved by providing a more detailed explanation of the arctan function's behavior at x = 0 and how it leads to the choice of θ = π/2. Additionally, the solution would benefit from clearer step-by-step calculations for r and θ, especially for the arctan part.

 The solution provided is a step-by-step guide to converting the point (0,3) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It correctly identifies the formulas for distance (r) and angle (θ) and applies them to the given point. However, it correctly addresses the issue of division by zero in the arctan function and correctly concludes that the angle θ is π/2 for a point on the positive y-axis. The solution is clear and concise, and the format is well-organized.

The only potential issue is that the language used in the final step is a bit informal, but this does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Question: Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Convert the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$
[Full step]: To convert the point $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates, we need to find the distance $r$ from the origin to the point and the angle $\theta$ that the line connecting the origin and the point makes with the positive x-axis. The distance $r$ can be found using the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},$ and the angle $\theta$ can be found using the formula $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$ Since the given point is $(0, 3),$ we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3.$ Substituting these values into the formulas, we get $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3,$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)}.$ However, since the point lies on the positive y-axis, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ because it forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Explore the relationship between the given point and the unit circle to infer the correct polar coordinates, leveraging the geometric properties of the unit circle and the point's position.
[Full step]: We observe that the point $(0,3)$ lies on the positive y-axis. The equation of the unit circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 1.$ Since the point is on the y-axis, we can substitute $x=0$ into the equation, resulting in $0^2 + y^2 = 1,$ which simplifies to $y^2 = 1.$ This implies that $y = \pm 1.$ However, since the point is at $y = 3,$ we can conclude that the point is actually at a distance of 3 from the origin in the positive y-direction, which means the polar coordinate is $(3, \frac{\pi}{2}).$ This is because the angle with the positive x-axis is 90 degrees, or $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians.


The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}

 The solution is well-written and clear in its steps, but it does not follow the exact format specified. The problem asks to evaluate the quality of the solution based on the objectives, but the solution does not directly address these objectives. The answer is correct, but it could be more clearly stated at the end of the solution instead of being buried in the explanation. The solution does not violate any known conditions and is correct, but the format and presentation could be improved.

This is a special case where the arctan function is not needed because we can determine the angle based on the coordinate values and the position of the point in the coordinate plane.

 The solution is clear and straightforward. It correctly identifies the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates and applies them to the given point. It also correctly determines the angle based on the position of the point on the positive y-axis. The final answer is provided in the required format.

However, the solution could be improved by providing a clear explanation for the case where the point lies on the y-axis, as this is not immediately obvious from the formulas used.

[Core idea]: Address the issue of the arctan calculation with the point (0,3) to determine a suitable angle, considering the cases where the denominator is zero.
[Full step]: Since we have a problem with the arctan function at x = 0 (division by zero), we need to consider the case when x = 0, and y > 0, which corresponds to the point being on the positive y-axis. In this case, the angle θ will be π/2 because the point forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis. This is a special case that needs to be handled separately. The correct polar coordinates are (r, θ) = (3, π/2).

 The solution is mostly correct in that it identifies the appropriate formulas to use for converting rectangular to polar coordinates. However, it does not clearly address the issue of the arctan calculation with the point (0,3) when x=0. It jumps directly to the conclusion that θ = π/2 without fully addressing the division by zero case, which is a common pitfall in polar coordinate conversions. The solution also ends abruptly without providing a final answer in the box, which should be (3, π/2). Additionally, it does not explicitly state that r = √(y^2) when x=0, which is a simpler and more direct approach to find r.

It correctly uses the formulas for $r$ and $\theta$, and accurately identifies the angle $\theta$ as $\frac{\pi}{2}$ based on the position of the point on the positive y-axis. However, it does not explicitly calculate $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)}$, implying that the step is unnecessary. The solution is well-organized and easy to follow.

 The solution is generally clear and concise, but it could be improved in terms of format and presentation. The main steps are correctly identified, and the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates are correctly applied. However, the solution could benefit from a clearer and more detailed explanation of the step where the angle θ is determined, especially considering that the point lies on the positive y-axis. The solution also does not provide a clear explanation for why the angle is π/2, which might be confusing for readers. Furthermore, the solution does not explicitly state that x = 0, which is an important detail that should be mentioned.

 The solution correctly identifies the formulas for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. However, it does not address the issue of the arctan calculation with the point (0,3) properly. The solution jumps to the conclusion that the angle is π/2 without justification. A more rigorous approach would involve considering the signs of x and y to determine the quadrant of the angle. Despite this, the solution correctly identifies the value of r and provides a correct answer. The format is mostly correct, with the exception of the final answer not being enclosed in a box.

Question: Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi.$

Step 1: <step>
[Core idea]: Convert the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$
[Full step]: To convert the point $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates, we need to find the distance $r$ from the origin to the point and the angle $\theta$ that the line connecting the origin and the point makes with the positive x-axis. The distance $r$ can be found using the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},$ and the angle $\theta$ can be found using the formula $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$ Since the given point is $(0, 3),$ we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3.$ Substituting these values into the formulas, we get $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3,$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)}.$ However, since the point lies on the positive y-axis, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ because it forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Recall that for points on the positive y-axis, the angle can be directly assigned a value based on the quadrant and the position of the point, without using the arctan function.
[Full step]: Since the point $(0,3)$ lies on the positive y-axis, we can directly assign an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ to it, as it forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis. This is a special case where the arctan function is not needed because we can determine the angle based on the coordinate values and the position of the point in the coordinate plane.

The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3,\frac{\pi}{2})}

 The solution provides a clear and step-by-step approach to convert the point from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It correctly identifies the formulas to use and applies them to the given values. The explanation is clear and concise, and the solution is well-organized.

However, the solution does not provide a detailed calculation for the arctan function, which might raise some concern about the accuracy of the angle calculation. Nevertheless, since the point lies on the positive y-axis, the angle is directly assigned as π/2, which is correct.

The solution does not violate any known conditions, and the answer is indeed correct. The format is well-organized, and the language is clear and concise.

The distance $r$ can be found using the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},$ and the angle $\theta$ can be found using the formula $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$ Since the given point is $(0, 3),$ we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3.$ Substituting these values into the formulas, we get $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3,$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)}.$ However, since the point lies on the positive y-axis, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ because it forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis.
</step>
Step 2: <step>
[Core idea]: Address the issue of the arctan calculation with the point (0,3) to determine a suitable angle, considering the cases where the denominator is zero.
[Full step]: Since we have a problem with the arctan function at x = 0 (division by zero), we need to consider the case when x = 0, and y > 0, which corresponds to the point being on the positive y-axis. In this case, the angle θ will be π/2 because the point forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis. This is a special case that needs to be handled separately. The correct polar coordinates are (r, θ) = (3, π/2).


The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}

 The solution is well-structured and clearly explains the steps involved in converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It correctly identifies the issue with the arctan function when x = 0 and y > 0, and provides a suitable solution for this case. The final answer is accurate and correctly formatted as (r, θ) = (3, π/2).

However, the solution could be improved by providing more detail in the step where the angle θ is calculated. A brief explanation for why θ = π/2 in this specific case would add clarity to the solution.

The solution does not violate any known conditions, and the answer is correct.

The correct polar coordinates are (r, θ) = (3, π/2).


The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}
