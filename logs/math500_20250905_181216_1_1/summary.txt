  推理路径:
    1. <step>
[Core idea]: Convert the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$
[Full step]: To convert the point $(0, 3)$ to polar coordinates, we need to find the distance $r$ from the origin to the point and the angle $\theta$ that the line connecting the origin and the point makes with the positive x-axis. The distance $r$ can be found using the formula $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},$ and the angle $\theta$ can be found using the formula $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)}.$ Since the given point is $(0, 3),$ we have $x = 0$ and $y = 3.$ Substituting these values into the formulas, we get $r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3,$ and $\theta = \arctan{\left(\frac{3}{0}\right)}.$ However, since the point lies on the positive y-axis, $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ because it forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis.
</step>
    2. <step>
[Core idea]: Address the issue of the arctan calculation with the point (0,3) to determine a suitable angle, considering the cases where the denominator is zero.
[Full step]: Since we have a problem with the arctan function at x = 0 (division by zero), we need to consider the case when x = 0, and y > 0, which corresponds to the point being on the positive y-axis. In this case, the angle θ will be π/2 because the point forms a 90-degree angle with the positive x-axis. This is a special case that needs to be handled separately. The correct polar coordinates are (r, θ) = (3, π/2).


The final answer to the question is \boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}
