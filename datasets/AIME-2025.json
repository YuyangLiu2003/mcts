    "solution": "Note that the triangles outside $\triangle ABC$ have the same height as the unshaded triangles in $\triangle ABC$.

    "solution": "Notice that if the 8-digit number is divisible by $22$, it must have an even units digit. Therefore, we can break it up into cases and let the last digit be either $2, 4, 6,$ or $8$. Due to symmetry, upon finding the total count of one of these last digit cases (we look at last digit $2$ here), we may multiply the resulting value by $4$. \nNow, we just need to find the number of positions of the remaining numbers such that the units digit is $2$ and the number is divisible by $11$. Denote the odd numbered positions to be $a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7$ and the even numbered positions to be $a_2, a_4, a_6$ (recall $a_8=2$). By the divisibility rule of $11$, we must have:\\[(a_1 + a_3 + a_5 + a_7) - (a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + 2)\\]which is congruent to $0\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}11)$. Therefore, after simplifying, we must have:\\[a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - a_4 + a_5 - a_6 + a_7\\equiv2\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}11)\\]Now consider $a_1+ a_2 +\\ldots + a_7=1+2+\\ldots+8-2=34\\equiv1\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}11)$. Therefore,\\[(a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots+ a_7) - 2(a_2 + a_4 + a_6)\\equiv2\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}11)\\]which means that\\[a_2 + a_4 + a_6\\equiv5\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}11)\\]Notice that the minimum of $a_2+a_4+a_6$ is $1 + 3 + 4 = 8$ and the maximum is $6 + 7 + 8 = 21$. The only possible number congruent to $5\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}11)$ in this range is $16$. All that remains is to count all the possible sums of $16$ using the values $1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$. There are a total of four possibilities:\\[(1, 7, 8), (3, 5, 8), (3, 6, 7), (4, 5, 7)\\]The arrangement of the odd-positioned numbers ($a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7$) does not matter, so there are $4!=24$ arrangements of these numbers. Recall that the $4$ triplets above occupy $a_2,a_4,a_6$; the number of arrangements is $3!=6$. Thus, we have $24\\cdot6\\cdot4=576$ possible numbers such that the units digit is $2$. Since we claimed symmetry over the rest of the units digits, we must multiply by $4$, resulting in $576\\cdot4=2304$ eight-digit positive integers.

Find $m+n$.",
    "solution": "Note that order does not matter here. This is because any permutation of the $6$ pairs will automatically get ordered in alphabetical order. The same is true for within each of the pairs. In other words, AB CH DI EJ FK GL should be counted equally as HC AB DI EJ FK GL. \nWe construct two cases: $G$ is the first letter of the last word and $G$ is the second letter of the last word. \nOur first case is when $G$ is the first letter of the last word. Then the second letter of the last word must be one of $H, I, J, K, L$. Call that set of $5$ letters $\\omega$. There are $5$ ways to choose the second letter from $\\omega$. The other $4$ letters of $\\omega$ must be used in the other $5$ words. \nFor the other 5 words, each of their first letters must be before $G$ in the alphabet. Otherwise, the word with $G$ will not be the last. There are $6$ letters before $G$: $A,B,C,D,E,F$. Call that set of $6$ letters $\\sigma$. Exactly one of the words must have two letters from $\\sigma$. The other 4 will have their first letter from $\\sigma$ and the second letter from $\\omega$. There are $4!$ ways to determine the possible pairings of letters from $\\sigma$ and $\\omega$, respectively. \nTherefore, this case has $5 \\cdot {6\\choose{2}} \\cdot 4! = 5 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 24 = 1800$ orderings. \nThe second case is when $G$ is the second letter of the last word. You can see that the first letter of that word must be $F$. Otherwise, that word cannot be the last word. The other $5$ words must start with $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$. The second letter of each of those words will come from $\\omega$. There will be $5!$ ways to distribute the elements of $\\omega$ to one of $A, B, C, D, E$. There are therefore $5! = 120$ orderings in the case. \nIn total, there are $1800+120 = 1920$ orderings. However, we want the probability. The number of ways to put the $12$ letters into pairs is $11 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1$. This is true because we can say this: Start with $A$. It has $11$ options for who it will partner with. There are now $10$ letters left. Pick one of those letters. It has $9$ options for who it will partner with. There are now $8$ letters left. Continue until there are only $2$ letters left, and there is only $1$ option for that last word. Therefore, there will be $11 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1$ options. \nThe probability is therefore $\\frac{1920}{11 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{128}{693}$.

This bisector must pass the midpoint, $(2+k,\\frac{3}{2}),$ and have slope $\\frac{4}{3}.$ The segment connecting the point of tangency to the center of the circle has slope $\\frac{-3}{4},$ meaning the points of tangency can be $(29,17)$ or $(21,23).$ Solving the equation for the slope of the perpendicular bisector gives\\[\\frac{\\frac{3}{2}-23}{k+2-21}=\\frac{4}{3}\\]or\\[\\frac{\\frac{3}{2}-17}{k+2-29}=\\frac{4}{3},\\]giving $k=\\frac{23}{8}$ or $\\frac{123}{8}$, having a sum of $\\frac{73}{4} \\longrightarrow \\boxed{077}.$ \nThere's actually an easier way to do it using this method by utilizing the distance between point and line formula after building off of what is shown above. First we find the standard form of the perpendicular bisector, which can be found using the point-slope form: $y-b = m(x-a)$, where $a$ and $b$ are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of a point on the line. By plugging in $(2+k, \\frac{3}{2})$, we get $y-\\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{4}{3}(x-2-k)$, we can eventually find the standard form as $8x-6y-7-8k=0$. Now we use the distance between point and line formula on the center of the circle at $(25, 20)$ and the perpendicular bisector. We get $d = \\frac{|8\\cdot 25-6\\cdot 20-7-8k|}{\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}}$. Plugging in $d$ = 5 we can simplify this to $50 = |200-120-7-8k|$. We can finally solve for the absolute value equality and figure out $k = \\frac{23}{8}$ or $k = \\frac{123}{8}$.

Note that the probability that $A$ and $B$ intersect is the probability that $A_1$ is paired with $B_1,$ which is $\\dfrac{1}{2}.$ Thus, this case contributes to the total probability \n\\[\\dfrac{1}{3}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{6}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{2}=\\dfrac{1}{36}.\\] \n$\textbf{Case 2:}$ Segment $A$ has endpoints in two adjacent quadrants. \n[asy] pair A,B,C,D,E,F,O; A=(1,0);B=(0,1);C=(-1,0);D=(0,-1);E=(0.5,0.86602540);F=(-0.707106,0.707106);O=(0,0); draw(A--C);draw(B--D);draw(circle((0,0),1));draw(E--F,blue);dot(E,blue);dot(F,blue); [/asy] \nThis happens with probability $\\frac{2}{3}.$ WLOG let the two quadrants be $1$ and $2.$ We do cases in which quadrants segment $B$ lies in. \nQuadrants $1$ and $3,$ $1$ and $4,$ $2$ and $3,$ and $2$ and $4.$ This is similar to our first case above, so this contributes to the total probability \n\\[\\dfrac{2}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{1}{6}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{1}{6}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{1}{6}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)=\\dfrac{2}{9}\\] \nQuadrants $3$ and $4.$ This cannot intersect segment $A.$ \nQuadrants $1$ and $2,$ Similar to our third case above, this intersects segment $A$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2},$ so this case contributes to the total probability \n\\[\\dfrac{2}{3}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{6}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{2}=\\dfrac{1}{18}.\\]Thus, the probability that two segments intersect is\\[\\dfrac{1}{9}+\\dfrac{1}{18}+\\dfrac{1}{36}+\\dfrac{2}{9}+\\dfrac{1}{18}=\\dfrac{17}{36}.\\]Next, we will compute the expected number of intersections of a segment with the axes. WLOG let a segment have an endpoint in quadrant $1.$ Then, it will intersect each axis with probability $\\dfrac{2}{3}$ because two out of the three remaining quadrants let it intersect a specific axis, so the expected number of axes a segment intersects is $\\frac{4}{3}.$ \nSo, why do intersections matter? Because when adding a segment, it will pass through a number of regions, and for each region it passes through, it will split that region into two and add another region. The segment starts in a region, and for each intersection, it will enter another region, so the number of regions a segment passes through is $1$ more than the number of intersections with the axes and other segments. Thus, we have that by linearity of expectation the expected number of new regions created by adding a segment is\\[\\dfrac{17}{36}\\cdot(\text{number of segments already added})+\\dfrac{4}{3}+1,\\]so the number of new regions added in total by $25$ segments again by linearity of expectation is\\[\\sum_{k=0}^{24}\\left(\\dfrac{17}{36}k+\\dfrac{7}{3}\\right)=\\dfrac{17}{36}\\cdot \\dfrac{24\\cdot 25}{2}+\\dfrac{25\\cdot 7}{3}\\]which simplifies to $200$ as the expected number of new regions added by the $25$ segments. The axes create $4$ regions to begin with, so our answer is\\[200+4=\\boxed{204}.\\]",

Find the remainder when $m+n$ is divided by $1000$.",
    "solution": "This problem can be split into three parts, listed below: \nPart 1: Analyzing Fractions \nLet $x_k=\\cfrac{a_k}{b_k}$, where $a_k,b_k$ are relatively prime positive integers. First, we analyze the moduli of the problem. Plugging in for $x_2$ yields $x_2=\\frac{157}{275}$. Notice that in both $x_1$ and $x_2$, the numerator is equivalent to $1$ and the denominator is equivalent to $2$ modulus $3$. We see that $x_2=\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{(a_1-b_1)^2+a_1b_1}{a_1b_1}$. Specifically, we know that\\[(a_1-b_1)^2+a_1b_1\\equiv(1-2)^2+1\\cdot2\\equiv0\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}3)\\]Then this is always divisible by $3$ for all $x_k$ (it can be shown that for all $x_k$, we have $a_k\\equiv1\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}3)$ and $b_k\\equiv2\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}3)$ by using $\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}9$). Thus, $x_2=\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}((a_1-b_1)^2+a_1b_1)}{a_1b_1}$, and the numerator and denominator of the right-hand side (RHS) correspond to the numerator and denominator of $x_2$ in simplest form. (To further prove that the top and bottom are relatively prime, consider that $a_k$ and $b_k$ are by definition relatively prime, so $(a_k-b_k)^2$ and $a_kb_k$ share no factors.) \nNotice that the above do not just apply to $x_1$; we did not use any specific properties of $x_1$. Then we may generalize the above, finding that:\\[a_k=\\frac{1}{3}((a_{k-1}-b_{k-1})^2+a_{k-1}b_{k-1})\\]\\[b_k=a_{k-1}b_{k-1}\\]Summing the equations yields $a_k+b_k=\\frac{1}{3}(a_{k-1}+b_{k-1})^2$ after some manipulation. Let $z_k=a_k+b_k$; then $z_k=\\frac{1}{3}z_{k-1}^2$. We are tasked with finding $z_{2025}$. \nPart 2: Recursion \nWe now need an explicit formula for $z_k$. We can first experiment with the recursive formula: \n$z_k=\\frac{1}{3}z_{k-1}^2=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}z_{k-2}^2\\right)^2=\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}z_{k-3}^2\\right)^2\\right)^2$ \nNotice that the inner $\\frac{1}{3}$ is acted upon by two consecutive powers of $2$. This means that it contributes $\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4$ to the value of $z_k$. The next innermost $\\frac{1}{3}$ is acted upon by one power of $2$, so it contributes $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2$ to the value of $z_k$. Finally, the outermost $\\frac{1}{3}$ is acted upon by no powers of $2$, so it contributes $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^1$ to the value of $z_k$. The overall power of $\\frac{1}{3}$ in $z_k$ in terms of $z_{k-3}$ is then $4+2+1=2^2+2^1+2^0=2^3-1$. Then, the overall power of $\\frac{1}{3}$ in $z_k$ in terms of $z_{k-a}$ is $2^a-1$ for positive integers $a$. \nWe also see that the $z_{k-3}$ term is acted upon by $3$ powers of $2$, meaning that its power is $2\\cdot2\\cdot2=2^3$. We can generalize this, so some $z_{k-a}$ term's power is then $2^a$. \nIf we combine the above, we obtain the formula $z_k=\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2^a-1}z_{k-a}^{2^a}$. Setting $k=a+1$ results in\\[z_{a+1}=\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2^a-1}z_1^{2^a}=36^{2^a}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2^a-1}\\]We can simplify this, noting that $36^{2^a}=12^{2^a}\\cdot3^{2^a}$:\\[z_{a+1}=12^{2^a}\\cdot3^{2^a}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^{2^a-1}=3\\cdot12^{2^a}\\]Finally, decrementing $a+1$ to $a$ gives us our explicit equation:\\[z_a=3\\cdot12^{2^{a-1}}\\] \nPart 3: Mod Bash \nNoting that $z_{2025}=3\\cdot12^{2^{2024}}$, we are asked to find its value mod $1000$. We can split mod $1000$ into mod $125$ and mod $8$. We know that $z_{2025}\\equiv0\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}8)$, so we must find its value mod $125$. \nWe find that $\\phi(125)=100$, so by Euler's Totient Theorem we know that $12^{100}\\equiv1\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}125)$. Then, since the power of $12$ is $2^{2024}$, we must find this over modulus $100$. \nAgain, we split mod $100$ into mod $4$ and mod $25$. We know that $2^{2024}\\equiv0\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}4)$. Since $\\phi(25)=20$, we can apply Euler again, finding that $2^{20}\\equiv1\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}25)$. Then\\[2^{2024}\\equiv(2^{20})^{101}\\cdot2^4\\equiv2^4\\equiv16\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}25)\\]Combining this with the mod $4$ result yields $2^{2024}\\equiv16\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}100)$. \nGoing back, $12^{2^{2024}}\\equiv12^{16}\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}125)$. We can then decrement this using a series of simplifications:\\[12^{16}\\equiv144^8\\equiv19^8\\equiv361^4\\equiv(-14)^4\\equiv196^2\\equiv(-54)^2\\equiv2916\\equiv41\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}125)\\]Remember that the original value of $z_{2025}$ included a multiplication of $3$; thus,\\[z_{2025}\\equiv41\\cdot3\\equiv123\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}125)\\]Finally, combining this with the fact that $z_{2025}\\equiv0\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}8)$, we find that the solution to the system of moduli is $z_{2025}\\equiv\\boxed{248}\\hspace{2mm}(\text{mod}\\hspace{1mm}1000)$.",

    "solution": "From the given condition, we could get $\\angle{LAK}=60^{\\circ}$ and $\triangle{LCA}, \triangle{BAK}$ are isosceles. Denote $\\angle{BAK}=\\alpha, \\angle{CAL}=30^{\\circ}-\\alpha$. From the isosceles condition, we have $\\angle{BKA}=180^{\\circ}-2\\alpha, \\angle{CLA}=120^{\\circ}+2\\alpha$ \nSince $\\angle{CAB}$ is right, then $AB^2+AC^2=BC^2$, we could use law of cosines to express $AC^2, AB^2, AC^2+AB^2=2\\cdot 14^2(2-\\cos \\angle{BKA}-\\angle {CLA})=2\\cdot 14^2(2+\\cos(2\\alpha)+\\cos(60^{\\circ}-2\\alpha))=38^2$ \nWhich simplifies to $\\cos(2\\alpha)+\\cos(60^{\\circ}-2\\alpha)=\\frac{165}{98}$, expand the expression by angle subtraction formula, we could get $\\sqrt{3}\\sin(2\\alpha+60^{\\circ})=\\frac{165}{98}, \\sin(2\\alpha+60^{\\circ})=\\frac{55\\sqrt{3}}{98}$ \nConenct $CK$ we could notice $\\angle{CLK}=360^{\\circ}-\\angle{CLA}-\\angle{ALK}=180^{\\circ}-2\\alpha=\\angle{AKB}$, since $CL=LK=AK=KB$ we have $\triangle{CLK}\\cong \triangle{AKB}$. Moreover, since $K$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AB$, the distance from $K$ to $AC$ is half of the length of $AB$, which means $[ACK]=\\frac{[ABC]}{2}$, and we could have $[ACK]=[ACL]+[ALK]+[ABK]=[ABC]-[BKLC]$, so $[BKLC]=[AKC]$.

    "solution": "We first do the same thing as Solution 1 did, but in mathematical language. \nLemma: for Polynomial $P(x)$, if $P(x_0) = 0$ and $P'(x_0) = 0$ both hold, then $x_0$ is a multiple root of $P(x)$. \nThis lemma is obvious since every root of $P(x)$ occurs $\\deg P - 1$ times in the derivative polynomial and any single root of $P(x)$ can't be a root of $P'(x)$. \nSimply name m as the minimum value of $f(x)$. \nThen $f(x) \\geq m$ and the equal sign holds if and only of $x=x_1$ or $x=x_2$. \nDefine $P(x)=(x-18)(x-72)(x-98)(x-k)-mx$. Obviously, $x_1$ and $x_2$ satisfy the two properties in the lemma. So we've got:\\[(x-18)(x-72)(x-98)(x-k)-mx = (x-x_1)^2(x-x_2)^2\\]Take $x=18, 72, 98, k$, we get:\\[(18-x_1)(18-x_2)= \\pm\\sqrt{-m}\\sqrt{18}\\]and so on. So we can construct $Q(t)=(t^2-x_1)(t^2-x_2)-\\sqrt{-m}t$. As what we have seen, $\\pm\\sqrt{18}, \\pm\\sqrt{72}, \\pm\\sqrt{98}, \\pm\\sqrt{k}$ are four roots of $Q(t) = 0$. So we've got:\\[Q(t)=(t^2-x_1)(t^2-x_2)-\\sqrt{-m}t=(t\\pm\\sqrt{18})(t\\pm\\sqrt{72})(t\\pm\\sqrt{98})(t\\pm\\sqrt{k})\\]Comparing the cubic coefficient:\\[\\pm\\sqrt{18}\\pm\\sqrt{72}\\pm\\sqrt{98}\\pm\\sqrt{k}=0\\]So\\[k=(\\pm\\sqrt{18}\\pm\\sqrt{72}\\pm\\sqrt{98})^2\\]Now $8, 32, 200, 512$ are accesible in this form. The final task is to eliminate $512$. In this occasion the four roots are either $\\sqrt{18}, \\sqrt{72}, \\sqrt{98}, -\\sqrt{512}$ or $-\\sqrt{18}, -\\sqrt{72}, -\\sqrt{98}, \\sqrt{512}$. In either way the constant coefficient of $Q(t)$ is\\[x_1x_2 = -\\sqrt{18}\\sqrt{72}\\sqrt{98}\\sqrt{512}\\]But, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both positive, so we end up with contradiction. \n$8+32+200=\\boxed{240}$",
