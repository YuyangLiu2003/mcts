    "problem": "When $n$ standard six-sided dice are rolled, the product of the numbers rolled can be any of $936$ possible values. What is $n$?",
    "solution": "We start by trying to prove a function of $n$, and then we can apply the function and equate it to $936$ to find the value of $n$.\nIt is helpful to think of this problem in the format $(1+2+3+4+5+6) \\cdot (1+2+3+4+5+6) \\dots$. Note that if we represent the scenario in this manner, we can think of picking a $1$ for one factor and then a $5$ for another factor to form their product - this is similar thinking to when we have the factorized form of a polynomial. Unfortunately this is not quite accurate to the problem because we can reach the same product in many ways: for example for $n=2$, $4$ can be reached by picking $1$ and $4$ or $2$ and $2$. However, this form gives us insights that will be useful later in the problem.\nNote that there are only $3$ primes in the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$: $2,3,$ and $5$. Thus if we're forming the product of possible values of a dice roll, the product has to be written in the form $2^h \\cdot 3^i \\cdot 5^j$ (the choice of variables will become clear later), for integer nonnegative values $h,i,j$. So now the problem boils down to how many distinct triplets $(h,i,j)$ can be formed by taking the product of $n$ dice values. \nWe start our work on representing $j$: the powers of $5$, because it is the simplest in this scenario because there is only one factor of $5$ in the set. Because of this, having $j$ fives in our prime factorization of the product is equivalent to picking $j$ factors from the polynomial $(1+\\dots + 6) \\cdots$ and choosing each factor to be a $5$. Now that we've selected $j$ factors, there are $n-j$ factors remaining to choose our powers of $3$ and $2$. \nSuppose our prime factorization of this product contains $i$ powers of $3$. These powers of $3$ can either come from a $3$ factor or a $6$ factor, but since both $3$ and $6$ contain only one power of $3$, this means that a product with $i$ powers of $3$ corresponds directly to picking $i$ factors from the polynomial, each of which is either $3$ or $6$ (but this distinction doesn't matter when we consider only the powers of $3$. \nNow we can reframe the problem again. Our method will be as follows: Suppose we choose an arbitrary pair $(i,j)$ that match the requirements, corresponding to the number of $3$'s and the number of $5$'s our product will have. Then how many different $h$ values for the powers of $2$ are possible?\nIn the $i+j$ factors we have already chosen, we obviously can't have any factors of $2$ in the $j$ factors with $5$. However, we can have a factor of $2$ pairing with factors of $3$, if we choose a $6$. The maximal possible power of $2$ in these $i$ factors is thus $2^i$, which occurs when we pick every factor to be $6$. \nWe now have $n-i-j$ factors remaining, and we want to allocate these to solely powers of $2$. For each of these factors, we can choose either a $1,2,$ or $4$. Therefore the maximal power of $2$ achieved in these factors is when we pick $4$ for all of them, which is equivalent to $2^{2\\cdot (n-i-j)}$.\nNow if we multiply this across the total $n$ factors (or $n$ dice) we have a total of $2^{2n-2i-2j} \\cdot 2^i = 2^{2n-i-2j}$, which is the maximal power of $2$ attainable in the product for a pair $(i,j)$. Now note that every power of $2$ below this power is attainable: we can simply just take away a power of $2$ from an existing factor by dividing by $2$. Therefore the powers of $2$, and thus the $h$ value ranges from $h=0$ to $h=2n-i-2j$, so there are a total of $2n+1-i-2j$ distinct values for $h$ for a given pair $(i,j)$. \nNow to find the total number of distinct triplets, we must sum this across all possible $i$s and $j$s. Lets take note of our restrictions on $i,j$: the only restriction is that $i+j \\leq n$, since we're picking factors from $n$ dice.\n\\[\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} 2n+1 - \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j\\]\nWe start by calculating the first term. $2n+1$ is constant, so we just need to find out how many pairs there are such that $i+j \\leq n$. Set $i$ to $0$: $j$ can range from $0$ to $n$, then set $i$ to $1$: $j$ can range from $0$ to $n-1$, etc. The total number of pairs is thus $n+1+n+n-1+\\dots+1 = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$. Therefore the left summation evaluates to \\[\\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]\nNow we calculate $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j$. This simplifies to $\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i + 2 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} j$. Note that because $i+j = n$ is symmetric with respect to $i,j$, the sum of $i$ in all of the pairs will be equal to the sum of $j$ in all of the pairs. Thus this is equal to calculating $3 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i$.\nIn the pairs, $i=1$ appears for $j$ ranging between $0$ and $n-1$ so the sum here is $1 \\cdot (n)$. Similarly $i=2$ appears for $j$ ranging from $0$ to $n-2$, so the sum is $2 \\cdot (n-1)$. If we continue the pattern, the sum overall is $(n)+2 \\cdot (n-1) + 3 \\cdot (n-2) + \\dots + (n) \\cdot 1$. We can rearrange this as $((n)+(n-1)+ \\dots + 1) + ((n-1)+(n-2)+ \\dots + 1)+ ((n-2)+(n-3)+ \\dots + 1) + \\dots + 1)$\n\\[= \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} + \\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2}+ \\dots + 1\\]\nWe can write this in easier terms as $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{(k)(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2+k$\n\\[=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 + \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k)\\]\n\\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2})\\]\n\\[= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{3n(n+1)}{6}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+4)}{6}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}\\]\nWe multiply this by $3$ to obtain that \\[\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]\nThus our final answer for the number of distinct triplets $(h,i,j)$ is:\n\\[\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2} - \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (2n+1-n) = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (n+1)\\]\n\\[= \\frac{(n+1)^2(n+2)}{2}\\]\nNow most of the work is done. We set this equal to $936$ and prime factorize. $936 = 12 \\cdot 78 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$, so $(n+1)^2(n+2) = 936 \\cdot 2 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$. Clearly $13$ cannot be anything squared and $2^4 \\cdot 3^2$ is a perfect square, so $n+2 = 13$ and $n = 11 = \\boxed{A}$\n\n",

    "problem": "You are playing a game. A $2 \\times 1$ rectangle covers two adjacent squares (oriented either horizontally or vertically) of a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares, but you are not told which two squares are covered. Your goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle. A \"turn\" consists of you guessing a square, after which you are told whether that square is covered by the hidden rectangle. What is the minimum number of turns you need to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle?",
    "solution": "Notice that the $3\\times3$ square grid has a total of $12$ possible $2\\times1$ rectangles.\nSuppose you choose the middle square for one of your turns. The middle square is covered by $4$ rectangles, and each of the remaining $8$ squares is covered by a maximum of $2$ uncounted rectangles. This means that the number of turns is at least $1+\\frac{12-4}{2}=1+4=5$.\nNow suppose you don't choose the middle square. The squares on the middle of the sides are covered by at most 3 uncounted rectangles, and the squares on the corners are covered by at most 2 uncounted rectangles. In this case, we see that the least number of turns needed to account for all 12 rectangles is $12\\div 3=4.$ To prove that choosing only side squares indeed does cover all 12 rectangles, we need to show that the 3 rectangles per square that cover each side square do not overlap. Drawing the rectangles that cover one square, we see they form a $T$ shape and they do not cover any other side square.
